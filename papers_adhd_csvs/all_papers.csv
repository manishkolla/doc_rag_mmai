Abstract
The efficacy of n-back training for children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) was tested in a randomized controlled trial. Forty-one children aged 7–14 with ADHD 
trained on an n-back task, and their performance was compared with that of an active control 
group (n = 39) who trained on a general knowledge and vocabulary task. The experimental group 
demonstrated transfer of training to a non-trained n-back task as well as to a measure of inhibitory 
control. These effects were correlated with the magnitude of training gains. Our results suggest 
that n-back training may be useful in addressing some of the cognitive and behavioral issues 
associated with ADHD.

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a developmental disorder characterized 
by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior. It is common; the National Survey of 
Children’s Health found that in 2011, 11% of US children ages 4–17 (i.e., 6.4 million) had 
ever been diagnosed with ADHD and 9% of children had a current diagnosis of ADHD 
(Visser et al., 2014 ) though prevalence rates vary across studies and hover around 6% in 
international samples ( Moffitt et al., 2015 ; Polanczyk, Willcutt, Salum, Kieling, & Rohde, 
2014 ). ADHD symptoms typically arise early in life (median age of diagnosis is 6 years; 
Visser et al., 2014 ), generally continue through adolescence, and persist into adulthood for 
30–60% of individuals diagnosed ( Barkley, 1997 ; Barkley, Fischer, Smallish, & Fletcher, 
2002 ; Faraone, Biederman, & Mick, 2005 ; Matte et al., 2015; Moffit et al., 2015 ). 
Approximately 80% of children with ADHD have academic performance problems and have 
a higher incidence of grade retention and dropping out of school compared to children 
without ADHD ( DuPaul & Stoner, 2014 ). As a result, ADHD often contributes to academic, 
social, and employment difficulties throughout the lifespan ( Barkley et al., 2002 ). Given the

"prevalence of ADHD, the chances are high that classrooms with 20 or more students include 
at least one individual with ADHD ( Abikoff et al., 2002 ). Because children with ADHD can 
be disruptive, learning of all students in the classroom can be affected (August et al., 1996). 
Thus there is a strong, practical need for the development of effective interventions to 
mitigate the symptoms and consequences of ADHD.
Though there are many facets to ADHD, the present study focuses primarily on working 
memory, inhibition, and the ADHD behaviors associated with those executive functions. 
Children with ADHD show impairments on a variety of working memory-related and 
executive control tasks. On average, children with ADHD perform worse than typically 
developing children on standard working memory tasks ( Karatekin & Asarnow, 1998 ; 
McInnes, Humphries, Hogg-Johnson, & Tannock, 2003 ; Sonuga-Barke, Dalen, Daley, & 
Remington, 2002 ; Westerberg, Hirvikoski, Forssberg, & Klingberg, 2004 ), and a number of 
studies have documented impairments among children with ADHD in executive function 
tasks, including the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( Pineda et al., 1998 ; Reeve & Schandler, 
2001 ), verbal fluency tasks ( Pineda et al., 1998 ), the Stroop task ( Reeve & Schandler, 2001 ), 
task-switching ( Cepeda, Cepeda, & Kramer, 2000 ; White & Shah, 2006 ), and the Tower of 
London task ( Cornoldi, Barbieri, Gaiani, & Zocchi, 1999 ). This is likely due to lower 
working memory capacity and reduced cognitive control in individuals with ADHD. As 
inhibitory and working memory skills are implicated in scholastic and non-scholastic 
achievement ( Friso-Van Den Bos, Van Der Ven, Kroesbergen, & Van Luit, 2013 ; Mcvay & 
Kane, 2012 ; St Clair-Thompson & Gathercole, 2006 ), interventions specifically targeting 
these mechanisms could be of great benefit for children with ADHD.
Interventions for ADHD
There are various approaches for ameliorating the challenges associated with ADHD; the 
most common method is stimulant medication. There are also non-pharmacological 
strategies such as behavioral interventions and cognitive training; some of these methods are 
often used in combination with stimulant medication.
Medication.
Although medication can be of great help, they are ineffective for up to 30% of individuals 
with ADHD ( Banaschewski, Roessner, Dittmann, Santosh, & Rothenberger, 2004 ). 
Furthermore, though ADHD medications are often seemingly effective in laboratory 
contexts, they seem to have less impact on everyday functional outcomes ( Pelham et al., 
2017 ). In addition, they are often associated with side effects such as reduced appetite and 
sleep disturbances ( Banaschewski et al., 2004 ). For these and other reasons, approximately 
20% of individuals with ADHD cease stimulant use within the first year of taking them 
(Toomey, Sox, Rusinak, & Finkelstein, 2012 ). It is not our aim to report a thorough overview 
on this topic, but interested readers may refer to Rubia et al. (2014)  for a meta-analysis.
Behavioral Therapy.
The most widely used non-pharmacological interventions for children with ADHD is 
behavioral management therapy (Evans, Owens, & Bunford, 2013; Wolraich et al., 2011 ). In Jones et al. Page 2

"these interventions, teachers (behavioral classroom management), or parents (behavioral 
parent therapy) are taught to reinforce children when they perform a desired behavior and to 
ignore undesired behaviors. This approach helps children to learn self-regulation skills, with 
typical outcomes including improved compliance to parent and teacher directions, as well as 
decreased disruptive behavior in the classroom. While behavioral therapies are generally 
considered the most effective non-pharmacological approaches for addressing ADHD 
symptomatology (Evans et al., 2013; Fabiano et al., 2009 ), many issues prevent these 
interventions from being available and effective for all children. Behavioral therapies can 
incur significant financial and time investments. Furthermore, new meta-analytic work 
suggests that although behavioral therapies may be successful in individual studies, a variety 
of factors related to both the design of the intervention and individual difference factors 
across participants may limit their effectiveness ( Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ).
Cognitive Training.
Another approach to treat ADHD is the use of “cognitive training” programs aimed at the 
core executive function deficits associated with ADHD. This approach is attractive in that, if 
effective, it may be lower in cost in terms of time, money, and potential side effects. Indeed, 
a recent meta-analysis of cognitive training ( Cortese et al., 2015 ) and non-pharmacological 
interventions for ADHD more broadly ( Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ), cognitive training was 
identified as an area that requires further exploration. As such, our study contributes to the 
growing literature on cognitive training interventions for individuals with ADHD. Currently, 
the most widespread and highly researched cognitive intervention for ADHD is Cogmed 
working memory training (CWMT), an online working memory training program that 
targets primarily the storage aspects of both verbal and visuospatial working memory. It is 
marketed to schools and clinicians as a tool for improving cognitive abilities, such as 
attention and reasoning ( Roberts et al., 2016 ). Some studies of CWMT in children with 
ADHD have shown improvements in ADHD-related symptoms as a function of training 
(Beck, Hanson, Puffenberger, Benninger, & Benninger, 2010 ; Klingberg et al., 2005 ; 
Klingberg, Forssberg, & Westerberg, 2002 ; Mezzacappa & Buckner, 2010 ), and a recent 
study by Bigorra, Garolera, Guijarro, and Hervas (2016)  demonstrated reductions in 
inhibitory control, as measured by CPT errors of commission. However, others have failed to 
replicate those findings, leading to conflicting reviews and meta-analyses ( Chacko et al., 
2013 ; van der Donk, Hiemstra-Beernink, Tjeenk-Kalff, van der Leij, & Lindauer, 2015; 
Shipstead, Hicks, & Engle, 2012 ). Additional challenges regarding CWMT include lengthy 
sessions (approximately 40 minutes per day over the course of 5 weeks), the necessity of a 
coach, and the significant cost ( Chacko et al., 2014 ).
Other cognitive training work has attempted to target inhibition directly. Shavlev, Tsal, & 
Mevorach (2002) , found improvements in attention and academic outcomes following an 
attentional control training program. Conversely, a recent large, randomized controlled trial 
of inhibitory control training found no evidence for training and transfer effects ( Enge et al., 
2014 ). Although some of the evidence is mixed, it may remain possible to train inhibition, 
especially if it occurs in combination with training working memory, as there seems to be 
considerable overlap between the domains of working memory and inhibitory control ( Hsu, 
Jaeggi, & Novick, 2017 ). Specifically, we have demonstrated transfer to inhibition via an Jones et al. Page 3

"inhibition and working memory-demanding executive functioning task, the n-back task, in 
young adults ( Hsu, Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Jaeggi, 2013 ) and typically developing children 
(Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Shah, 2011 ). The n-back task requires participants to 
respond to a series of stimuli by judging whether each stimulus is the same as the one 
presented n-items previously. The n-back task requires both active maintenance and updating 
of items in working memory as well as deleting items that are further back in a sequence. It 
also requires inhibiting responses to near target items, or lures. In Jaeggi and colleagues 
(2011) , inhibition was measured by the Conners’ Continuous Performance Task (CPT), 
which requires children to respond to all alphabetic letters appearing intermittently on a but 
withhold responses to the letter “X.” On average, children in the n-back training group 
exhibited fewer errors of commission compared to peers in a control condition. These results 
suggest that n-back training may be especially beneficial for children with ADHD, given 
that they are thought to suffer from underlying issues of inhibitory control. Furthermore, the 
CPT is often used as a diagnostic measure for ADHD in neuropsychology testing (e.g., 
Corkum & Siegel, 1993 ).
Based on the previous work in this domain, the goal of the present study was to examine 
whether training on the n-back task would improve the response inhibition skills of children 
with ADHD. Children with ADHD trained on a visuospatial version of the n-back task that 
was previously used with typically developing children ( Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Shah, 
et al., 2011 ). The participants’ performance was compared with that of an active control 
group that trained on vocabulary and general knowledge. Based on our prior work finding 
improvements on measures of response inhibition in typically-developing children and 
young adults, our primary hypothesis was that children with ADHD would also show 
improvements in response inhibition as measured by the CPT. Furthermore, because 
inhibitory control is purported to be a mechanism underlying self-regulation and cognitive/
achievement deficits in children with ADHD, we expected training on the n-back task may 
also lead to decreased ADHD symptoms (as measured by parent report) and improved 
academic ability (as measured by performance on math and reading measures from the 
Woodcock Johnson III; Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2003 ). Such a result would inform 
developing theories of cognitive training, offer support for theories implicating low 
inhibitory control as a contributor to ADHD, and provide preliminary evidence of the 
efficacy of n-back training as a useful intervention for children with ADHD. We also 
assessed general knowledge at posttest and delayed posttest as a control measure. For this 
task, which was largely identical to the training performed by the control group, we 
predicted that the control group would outperform the training group at delayed posttest.
Previous work has demonstrated improvements in working memory and fluid reasoning in 
typically-developing young adults following n-back training ( Au, Sheehan, et al., 2015 ; Au, 
Buschkuehl, Duncan, & Jaeggi, 2016 ). And furthermore, typically-developing children who 
showed improvement on the n-back task also demonstrated improvements on measures of 
fluid reasoning ( Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Shah, et al., 2011 ). We predicted that the 
training group in our study might outperform the control group on measures of working 
memory and fluid reasoning, however, fluid reasoning was considered exploratory, as there 
has been only limited evidence of fluid reasoning improvements in samples of children with Jones et al. Page 4

"learning or attention disorders. Based on our previous work, we also tested whether 
performance may be related to quality of training on the n-back task.
Children were assessed before training, immediately after training, and again after a three-
month delay. The purpose of the immediate posttest was to test for immediate changes as a 
result of training, and the purpose of the delayed posttest was twofold: to see whether any 
immediate changes could be sustained over time and to see whether any changes would 
manifest after a delay even if they were not measurable at immediate posttest. If improved 
inhibition leads to improved self-regulation, such changes may not be detectable in parent 
reports of ADHD symptomology without some period of time post-training. Likewise, if 
improved inhibition is beneficial for learning, and such changes may not have time to be 
reflected in achievement till students can use their enhanced inhibitory control skills in 
learning situations. Indeed, other cognitive interventions that impact academic achievement 
often do so only after delay (e.g., Klauer & Phye, 2008 ).
Finally, there is evidence that in cognitive training not all participants benefit equally from 
training ( Hussey & Novick, 2012 ; Katz, Jones, Shah, Buschkuehl, & Jaeggi, 2016; Jaeggi et 
al., 2011 ). Those who perform well on the training task tend to benefit more from the 
training, demonstrating greater improvements on untrained tasks such as reasoning and 
reading comprehension ( Hussey & Novick, 2012 ; Jaeggi, et al., 2011 ). It is possible that 
others lack interest during training, or that they experience difficulty coping with the 
frustrations of the task as it became more challenging. The latter explanation is particularly 
likely in the case of children with ADHD, who tend to struggle with overcoming frustration 
(Seymour, Macatee, & Chronis-Tuscano, 2016 ). Accordingly, we predicted that the children 
with ADHD in our sample would vary in terms of training task performance, and that the 
training task performance would be related to performance on transfer tasks and parent 
report measures.
Method
Participants
This study was approved by the appropriate ethics committee and performed in accordance 
with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later 
amendments. One hundred and eight children with ADHD from the communities around the 
University of Michigan were recruited to participate in the study via fliers and 
advertisements posted in primary care offices, schools and local newspapers. Parents were 
told that children would participate in a training protocol that might improve attention and 
problem solving skills. The only compensation for participants were small prizes (e.g., 
tickers, pencils, or small stuffed animals.). Informed consent was obtained from all 
individual participants included in the study. Most children were from upper middle-class 
backgrounds (see Table 1). Seven were excluded due to comorbid diagnoses in addition to 
ADHD (e.g., autism). For data analyses, we included only participants who completed at 
least 15 out of 20 training sessions and who trained for at least 4 weeks, but not longer than 
6 weeks, and who had no major training or posttest scheduling irregularities (such as 
training three times per day instead of once a day). Based on those criteria, we excluded 
twenty-one children for failure to comply with the training schedule. Our final sample Jones et al. Page 5

"consisted of 80 children ( mean age : 10.14 years; SD: 2.02; range : 7–14; 25 girls). All 
participants met diagnostic criteria on the The Conners’ Parent Questionnaire – Revised: 
Long Form (CPRS–R:L; Conners, Sitarenios, Parker, & Epstein, 1998 ; Conners, 2001 ) or 
the The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991 ; Chang, Wang, & Tsai, 2016 ). 
Additionally, all participants had been diagnosed with ADHD by a clinician (i.e., 
pediatrician, psychologist or psychiatrist), according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders ( DSM-IV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder, 1994 ) 
criteria. Although the ADHD diagnoses made by clinicians were not standardized across 
participants, we chose this present approach as it is representative for how ADHD is 
typically diagnosed in the community, and furthermore, our main goal was to test the 
efficacy of our intervention in an ecologically valid context. Participants could be no 
younger than seven, as the control task required participants to read at a somewhat fluent 
level. Participants could also be no older than 14, as the task design and background stories 
of the intervention were created with younger children in mind, and might not have been 
appropriately engaging for older adolescents.
As they were recruited, participants in the two groups were continuously matched on 
measures of fluid reasoning (TONI and SPM), age, gender and ADHD symptom severity (as 
measured by parent rated CPRS–R:L Comprehensive Behavior Rating Scales) by a 
researcher who was neither involved in testing nor in training of the participants. Based on 
this matched pairing, participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: n-back 
training (n=41) or an active knowledge training control condition (n=39). Of these 
participants, 19 in the training group and 15 in the control group were actively taking 
medication for ADHD. See table 1 for full demographic information.
Procedure
Participants came to the lab for two 60-minute sessions to complete pretest measures. Pretest 
measures included tasks that were structurally similar to the training tasks (termed “near 
transfer”), tasks that were dissimilar to the training tasks (“far transfer”), and parent report 
measures. Participants were required to train at home once per day for 20 sessions with 
parent supervision, and in addition, children came to train in the lab, a library, or another 
public place once a week for a researcher-supervised training session (16 sessions at home, 4 
sessions supervised, over the course of about 5 weeks). The children returned for a posttest 
session immediately following training completion, and they returned again for a second, 
delayed posttest to complete the same measures three months later to discern whether any 
differences between groups persisted over time.
All pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest descriptive statistics along with re-test reliability 
estimates and effect sizes are provided in the supplemental online material (SOM) tables 1–
3.
Measures
N-Back Training.— Participants in the experimental condition trained on a game-like 
computerized cognitive training task similar to that used in previous studies with typically 
developing children ( Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Shah, et al., 2011 ). This spatial n-back Jones et al. Page 6

"task presented participants with images at one of six locations on the screen at a rate of three 
seconds each, each image presented for 500 ms followed by a 2,500 ms interstimulus 
interval. The participants’ task was to decide whether a stimulus appeared at the same 
location as the one presented n items back in the sequence. Participants pressed the ‘A’ key 
each time the current image was in the same location as the one presented n items previously 
(targets) and the ‘L’ key if the image did not match (non-targets). There were five randomly 
positioned targets per block of trials, and each block included 15 + n trials. Each training 
session consisted of 10 rounds lasting approximately one minute each. Participants were 
provided with performance feedback at the end of each round as well as at the end of the 
training session. A complete training session lasted approximately 15 minutes.
The levels in the game corresponded to the n back that the participant had to remember. The 
n was adaptive, such that successfully completing a round at a particular level (three or 
fewer errors) resulted in the next round being more difficult by increasing the level of n, 
whereas poor performance (four or more errors) resulted in “losing a life.” At the end of 
each round, points were calculated and awarded in the form of virtual gold coins. At higher 
levels that were more challenging, more points were awarded per correct response and more 
points could be earned per round. If three lives were lost on a same level, the player would 
be moved down one level and receive three more lives. Moving down a level was not 
intended as a penalty, but rather as a means to keep the difficulty of the game within the 
participants’ level of maximum ability.
Control Training.— Participants in the active control training group completed a general 
knowledge and trivia program as used before (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Shah, et al., 
2011), in which they answered questions about vocabulary, history, and general-knowledge 
facts. Time on task and reinforcers were similar as time for the n-back training group. 
Questions such as “What is Orion’s Belt?” were presented and participants selected from 
four answer alternatives shown below the question. Participants were provided with 
feedback on their performance, and questions which were answered incorrectly were 
repeated in the next session. This game also had levels and was adaptive, but only minimally 
implicated working memory or controlled attention.
There were four different themes in both the n-back and the control training. The themes 
were implemented in order to make the training task more interesting for children. After five 
training sessions, the theme would automatically switch to the next one. The general training 
features (e.g., levels, bonuses, scores) would stay the same regardless of the presented 
theme. While playing the games at home, the child would be earning points and virtual gold 
coins, which he or she would later be able to trade in for trivial prizes (stickers, pencils, 
stuffed animals, etc.) after the supervised training sessions. Participants received no other 
compensation.
Near Transfer Tasks.— The participants completed an untrained (non-spatial/identity) 
version of the n-back task as previously used ( Katz, Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Stegman, & Shah, 
2014 ), in which they were presented with a series of colored objects (e.g. a penguin, a 
flower, a lemon) in the center of the screen, and they had to indicate whether or not the 
current stimulus was the same as the one n positions back in the sequence. Unlike the Jones et al. Page 7

"training task, which was adaptive, the n-back level was fixed at 2-back, and children 
completed only three rounds (20+n trials each). The fixed level of n-back was chosen based 
on our previous work with typically developing children ( Jaeggi et al., 2011 ), showing that 
this task at that level and using those stimuli is adequate in terms of difficulty, in that we 
were expecting enough variability allowing us to assess transfer. The fixed level also allowed 
us to assess participants’attention and impulsivity (noticing and rejecting lure trials) in 
addition to working memory. The dependent variable was the proportion of hits minus the 
proportion of false alarms. This task was administered at pretest, posttest, and at delayed 
posttest. Participants also completed a multiple-choice quiz similar to the control training 
task. This was included as a near transfer task for the control group and a control task for the 
n-back training group as we did not predict improvements in general knowledge as a 
function of cognitive training. This quiz was administered at posttest and at delayed posttest 
only.
Cognitive Far Transfer Tasks.— These measures were administered at pretest, posttest, 
and delayed posttest. We used the CPT to assess sustained attention and inhibitory control 
by having participants respond as quickly as possible to stimuli (letters; go trials), but to 
withhold responses for a small percentage of trials (i.e., upon presentation of the letter “X”; 
no-go trials). The letters were presented in the center of the screen (white on black 
background) for a duration of 250 ms. Our task was modeled after Conners et al., (2003) , 
consisting of 18 blocks with 20 trials each (360 total trials). Each block differed in the 
duration of the interstimulus interval, which was 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ms long. The order 
of the blocks was randomized. The ratio of go- vs. no-go trials was 9:1. Our dependent 
measure was false alarm rates. Split-half reliability for the CPT has been reported as 0.83 
(range 0.66 to 0.95; Conners et al., 2000 ; 1994 ).
All participants completed two verbal working memory measures that were not n-back tasks. 
For analyses, a composite score of working memory was created using standardized z-scores 
averaged from both tasks, i.e. Digit Span (forward and backward) and Following Directions. 
The digit span required participants to read lists of digits and repeat them either in order 
(forward digit span) or in the reverse order of presentation (backward digit span; Wechsler, 
2003 ). List lengths varied from two to nine (two trials per list length), and the task was 
ended if participants failed at both trials of a particular list length. The dependent variable 
was the number of correctly recalled sequences. Parallel-test versions (counterbalanced 
across participants) were used for pre- and posttest, however, for the delayed posttest, the 
version used at pretest was administered. In the following directions task ( Gathercole, 
Durling, Evans, Jeffcook, & Stone, 2008 ), participants were seated in front of an array of 
familiar objects (boxes, folders, pencils, rulers, erasers) in three different colors (blue, 
yellow, and red). Participants were asked to execute a spoken instruction such as “Pick up 
the blue pencil and put it in the yellow box.” The task instructions became increasingly 
complex (i.e., containing more actions) throughout the measure, up to a level when the 
participant made three consecutive errors within one level of complexity. The number of 
actions ranged from one to seven (levels 1–7), and each level contained six trials. The 
dependent variable was calculated as the sum of the number of actions in sequence that the 
child could accurately complete all trials of, plus 0.25 for each correct trial at the next span Jones et al. Page 8

"level. For example, if a child successfully completed six trials with three actions (this counts 
three towards the dependent variable), completes one correct trial with four actions (this 
counts 0.25 towards the dependent variable), then fails the subsequent trials with four 
actions, their score would be a span of 3.25 ( Holmes, Gathercole, & Dunning, 2009 ; see also 
Ramani, Jaeggi, Daubert, & Buschkuehl, 2017 ). Parallel-test versions (counterbalanced 
across participants) were used for pre- and posttest, and for the delayed posttest, the version 
used at pretest was administered.
Far Transfer to ADHD Symptoms.— Three standardized parent questionnaires were 
administered at pretest and at the delayed posttest three months after the training had ended, 
providing insight into whether there were any observable behavioral differences resulting 
from cognitive training. Here we focus on specific sub-scales measuring ADHD symptoms 
related to executive functioning, but for completeness, the descriptive data for all scales are 
provided in SOM Table 3.
The CBCL assesses behavioral problems in children. Cronbach’s alpha for the narrow scales 
(syndrome and DSM-oriented) is reported as 0.83, and for the broad scales (internalizing, 
externalizing, and total problems), it is 0.94 ( Bullard, Griss, Greene, & Gekker, 2013 ). The 
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & 
Kenworthy, 2000 ) measures executive functioning in children. Cronbach’s alpha for the 
scales range from 0.80–0.98 ( Gioia et al., 2000 ). The CPRS–R:L provides seven scales: 
oppositional, cognitive problems/inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, anxious-shy, 
perfectionism, social, and psychosomatic problems. Cronbach’s alpha for the scales range 
from 0.75–0.95 ( Conners et al., 1998 ).
For the purpose of the present paper, specific scales were selected for analyses based on our 
hypotheses. Parent report of executive functioning was measured using the BRIEF Executive 
Functioning sub-scale. As we were interested in inattention and hyperactivity, we used 
composite z-scores from the following scales: attention problems and ADHD problems from 
the CBCL and the inattention and hyperactivity scales from the CPRS–R:L. This approach 
was taken to minimize familywise error inflation, reducing the overall number of 
comparisons. However, for completeness, the descriptive results of all scales are reported in 
SOM Table 3.
School-Related Far Transfer Tasks.— Three school-related tasks were administered. 
For analyses, a composite score for academic ability was created using z-scores from the 
Woodcock Johnson III Passage Comprehension, Math Applied Problem Solving, and 
Reading Fluency ( Woodcock et al., 2003 ). Individual test reliabities using a split half 
method are reported as 0.80 or higher ( Grenwelge, 2009 ). For all school-related tasks, 
parallel-test versions (counterbalanced across participants) were administered for pre- and 
post-test, and for the delayed posttest, the version used at pretest was administered. The 
Passage Comprehension subtest of the Woodcock Johnson III was used to measure 
participants’ reading comprehension. Participants read progressively more challenging 
passages and answered questions about them. The cut-off for this task was six sequential 
incorrect responses within a set, and the dependent variable was the total number of correct 
responses. The Math Applied Problem Solving subset of the Woodcock Johnson III was Jones et al. Page 9

"used to measure participants’ broad math skills. Participants solved math word problems. 
The cut-off for this task was six sequential incorrect responses in a set, and the dependent 
variable was the total number of correct responses. The Reading Fluency subtest of the 
Woodcock Johnson III was used to measure participants’ automaticity in reading simple 
sentences. Participants were given three minutes to read simple sentences and judge if those 
sentences were true or false. The dependent variable was the number of correctly answered 
questions.
Far Transfer to Matrix Reasoning.— Participants were presented with incomplete, 
abstract patterns to be completed by selecting the missing part that logically completes the 
pattern or series. We used two standardized versions, the Ravens Standard Progressive 
Matrices (SPM; Raven, 2000 ) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI; Brown, 2003 ) 
The odd-even split-half corrected coefficient of reliability for SPM is 0.96 ( Raven, 2000 ), 
and Cronbach’s alpha for TONI is reported in the 0.80 and 0.90 range ( Brown, 2003 ). The 
cut off for the Ravens was 10 minutes, and the cut off for the TONI was three incorrect 
answers out of a sequence of five items. The dependent measure was the amount of correctly 
solved problems. We created a composite score for matrix reasoning using standardized z-
scores averaging the scores of both measures. These tasks were administered at pretest, 
posttest, and at delayed posttest. Parallel-test versions (counterbalanced across participants) 
were administered for pre- and posttest, and for the delayed posttest, the version used at 
pretest was administered.
Results
Primary Analyses
Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 22 and JASP Version 0.8.5.1. 
Descriptive data for the near and far transfer tasks are provided in SOM tables 1, 2, and 3. 
SOM tables 4 and 5 provide correlations between outcome measures at pretest, training gain, 
and gains on outcome measures. Note that there were no significant differences between 
groups on any of the variables of interest at pretest (all ps > .20). We interpret significance at 
the p < 0.05 level, but as this is an exploratory study, we provide the reader with rich 
information with which to assess our findings. This includes uncorrected p-values and p-
values corrected for multiple comparisons using the Hochberg-Benjamini method ( Hochberg 
& Benjamini, 1990 ), and in addition, we conducted Baysean analyses using default priors in 
JASP, which allow us to report Bayes Factors that quantify evidence for and against the null 
hypothesis ( Wagenmakers et al., 2017 ).
First, data were analyzed to test whether any significant group differences existed at pretest. 
Both groups completed an equivalent number of training sessions (experimental group: 
mean : 19.15; SD: 2.69; control group: mean : 19.62, SD: 1.71; t(78) = −0.93, p = 0.36, d = 
0.21). On average, children with ADHD improved by approximately half an n-back level, 
which is slightly below the improvement that has been observed in typically developing 
children ( Jaeggi et al., 2011 ). Then, our general approach to testing for differences between 
the training and the control group resulting from cognitive training was to conduct two-
group analyses of covariance. We analyzed the posttest performance using pretest as a Jones et al. Page 10

"covariate to test for immediate training efficacy. All analyses met the assumptions for 
ANCOV A with the exception of school-related skills at posttest, which violated the 
assumption of homogeneity of slopes. The analysis for this particular measure was therefore 
performed as an Analysis of Variance without a covariate. These posttest results are 
presented in table 3. Then we analyzed the delayed posttest with the pretest as a covariate to 
test for sustained changes. All these analyses met the assumptions for ANCOV A, and the 
results are presented in table 4.
In short, at post-test, we observed strong evidence of group differences in the non-trained n-
back task ( F(1,77) = 11.41, p = 0.001, η2p = 0.13, BF = 29.50), as well as well as substantial 
evidence for group differences in the measure of inhibitory control (CPT; F(1, 77) = 6.48, p 
= 0.01, η2p = 0.08, BF = 3.73). At delayed post-test, the group differences remained, 
however, the effects were less pronounced than at post-test, and furthermore, they did not 
survive corrections for multiple comparisons (non-trained n-back: F(1, 54) = 4.56, p = 0.04, 
η2p = 0.08, BF = 1.74; CPT: ( F(1, 54) = 4.34, p = 0.04, η2p = 0.07, BF = 1.55), see figure 1. 
We also observed anecdotal evidence of reduced ADHD symptoms as reported by the 
parents ( F(1, 43) = 3.38, p = 0.07, η2p = 0.07, BF = 1.11; see figure 2). Descriptive statistics 
by group for pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest are displayed in table 5.
Finally, multiple regression analyses were conducted to test whether the amount of training 
improvement in the training group predicted performance on untrained measures (see table 
6). Training improvement was measured as the average score on the last two training 
sessions minus the average score on the first two training sessions. This approach was 
guided by our hypothesis that cognitive training is most effective when participants are 
actively engaged and put effort into doing their best. Assumptions for multiple regressions 
were tested and met. The analyses suggested that training performance was predictive for 
transfer in several measures, specifically, in CPT at posttest ( b = −6.93, p = 0.03, BF = 1.34), 
parent-reported ADHD symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity ( b = −0.26, p = 0.02, BF 
= 2.58), posttest school-related tasks ( b = 0.14, p = 0.04, BF = 0.26), matrix reasoning at 
posttest ( b = 0.21, p = 0.05, BF = 0.93), and matrix reasoning on delayed posttest ( b = 0.36, 
p = 0.01, BF = 3.90).
Exploratory Analyses
Motivation.— To investigate the possibility that any effects were due to motivational 
differences between groups, all children were asked at the end of each training session to 
rate how much they enjoyed the training on a scale from 1–5 where 1 was “I really did not 
enjoy the game” and 5 was “I really enjoyed the game.” The average rating of the control 
group was 3.84 (SD = 0.89), and the average rating of the training group was 3.27 (SD = 
0.84). The difference between the groups was significant ( p = 0.004; d = 0.66), indicating 
that the control group enjoyed their task more than the training group. This suggests that any 
differences between groups cannot be attributed to the experimental group enjoying their 
task more than the control group.
Additionally, participants were asked to rate how much effort they put into the game in order 
to test for differences in engagement between group. Effort was rated on a 5-point scale 
where 1 was “very little” and 5 was “too much.” The average rating of the control group was Jones et al. Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper1.pdf,11
"3.25 (SD = 1.13), and the average rating of the experimental group was also 3.23 (SD = 
1.17). The difference between the groups was not significant ( p = 0.92; d = 0.02), suggesting 
that neither group was more engaged than the other.
Medication.— Although our limited sample size makes it difficult to compare children in 
the training group who were medicated ( n=19) to children in the training group who were 
not medicated ( n=15), the question of whether medication influences training efficacy is 
important enough to warrant an exploratory analysis. The training gain (the average score on 
the last two training sessions minus the average score on the first two sessions) was 
compared between medicated and un-medicated children. There was no significant training 
gain difference between groups (medicated: mean gain = .55, SD = .85; not medicated: mean 
gain = .84, SD = .77; p = .31, d = .36), suggesting that the training program was equally 
beneficial for children who were and were not taking medication for their ADHD symptoms.
ADHD Severity.— To explore the relationship between ADHD severity and training gain, a 
linear regression of ADHD symptoms (as measured by the Connors at pretest) on training 
gain was performed. ADHD severity did not significantly predict training gain ( b = −.04, p 
= .08).
Discussion
Children who struggle with ADHD are hypothesized to have underlying executive 
functioning deficits, particularly in inhibitory control and working memory. In the present 
study, we tested the hypothesis that training children with ADHD in those two domains 
would lead to improvements on executive functioning skills that rely upon inhibition and 
working memory, and also to reductions in ADHD symptoms related to those executive 
functioning skills. Our results indicate that training inhibition, embedded in what is 
classically considered a working memory task n-back training that targets both working 
memory and inhibition resulted in substantial improvements in a non-spatial variant of the n-
back task, and in addition, we observed improved inhibitory control (as measured by the 
CPT), albeit with small effect sizes, and marginally reduced parent-reported symptoms of 
inattention and hyperactivity three months after training completion. However, this latter 
finding, which approached significance when uncorrected, failed to reach significance when 
adjusted for multiple comparisons. Nonetheless, we feel that this outcome is worth exploring 
in future studies with larger sample sizes. It remains possible that these symptoms may be 
reduced through cognitive training, which is relatively easy to implement compared to some 
other previously discussed interventions. Though these data are not conclusive, we believe 
that these findings are worth reporting to the clinical and research communities as they may 
help guide future research in this domain.
Our regression analyses revealed that the amount of training gain predicted the amount of 
transfer for CPT, inattention and hyeractivity, school tasks, and matrix reasoning (see Table 
5). This finding supports our hypothesis and corroborates previous work that the extent to 
which training is effective is relevant for transfer ( Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, Shah, et al., 
2011 ). If students do not actually improve throughout training, one would not expect that 
practice per se would yield any transfer ( Solomon & Perkins, 1989 ). This finding highlights Jones et al. Page 12

"the importance of examining training performance in cognitive training studies. It also 
suggests that one way of boosting effectiveness of cognitive training interventions is to 
ensure that participants maintain engagement with training tasks and are able to learn from 
their practice. Future studies could address the extent to which motivational factors 
embedded within the training task or different adaptivity parameters or scaffolding are 
helpful. This issue may be especially important for studies of children with ADHD, as they 
are more likely to be discouraged when facing challenging cognitive tasks ( Seymour et al., 
2016 ).
The effect of training gain on transfer is helpful for interpreting our positive transfer effects 
on parent ratings of behavior. Specifically, one might question the objectivity of a parent 
reported measures, arguing that a parent could figure out whether his or her child was in the 
training or the control group, and that this knowledge would bias questionnaire responses 
(Cortese et al., 2015 ). However, though parents may discover which condition their child 
was in, they are likely to be unaware of whether they actually improved on the training task, 
as the training was completed in the home and as there was no interaction between the 
participating families. The fact that training gain was associated with parent reports of 
behavior suggests that the findings were not likely due to parent expectations.
On the near transfer measure, the object n-back task, there was a significant difference 
between groups, as predicted. However, the regression analysis revealed no significant 
relationship between the amount of training gain on the object n-back performance. 
Although we did predict that greater training gains would be associated with greater transfer 
performance, the lack of such a finding on this particular measure may not be, in retrospect 
altogether surprising, because the object n-back task was fixed at a 2-back level. For all 
participants in the training group, the average n-back level on the very first day of training 
was 2.4. Thus, even low-performing participants who did not achieve high levels of n-back 
training still had ample practice at 2-back, providing no advantage to the higher-performing 
participants on this particular measure.
Although we predicted that the control group would improve relative to the training group 
on the trivia quiz (the near transfer measure of general knowledge), no significant 
differences were found between the two groups. One explanation might be that both groups 
began with high enough general knowledge that this control intervention had no significant 
effect, or alternatively, that both groups improved equally. As we have no pretest measure of 
general knowledge, we cannot evaluate these potential explanations.
Our composite measure of working memory yielded no significant differences between 
groups. The working memory tasks used to form the composite score were digit span and 
following directions, both of which seem to require active recall rather than updating and 
recognition, which are primarily involved in n-back, and thus, transfer from n-back to those 
tasks might be limited ( Jaeggi, Studer-Luethi, et al., 2010 ; Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Perrig, & 
Meier, 2010 ). Furthermore, both working memory outcome measures were verbal tasks 
while the training task was spatial. One might reasonably expect little transfer across these 
distinct working memory subsystems, especially also given previous literature that has 
shown larger correlations between n-back and visual WM tasks as compared to verbal WM Jones et al. Page 13

"tasks ( Waris et al., 2017 ), as well as limited transfer to verbal domains in general ( Au et al., 
2015 ; Buschkuehl et al., 2008 ; Colom et al., 2013 ). In a recent meta-analysis of n-back 
cognitive training by Soveri, Antfolk, Karlsson, Salo, and Laine (2017) , transfer to working 
memory tasks yielded smaller effect sizes as compared to the effect sizes found following 
cognitive training using more traditional working memory training paradigms ( Melby-
Lervåg & Hulme, 2013 ; Weicker, Villringer, & Thöne-Otto, 2015 ; Schwaighofer, Fischer, & 
Bühner, 2015 ). However, the fact that an effect seemed to emerge at delayed posttest with 
the uncorrected p-value leaves open the possibility ( BF = 2.32) that transfer to other working 
memory domains may be possible, but that a considerable amount of time might be required 
for such effects to occur or that robust effects might require more training.
We tentatively predicted transfer of n-back training to our composite measure of matrix 
reasoning especially for children who improved in the task based on previous work with 
typically developing young adults and children ( Jaeggi et al., 2011 ; Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, 
Shah, & Jonides, 2014 ). We also expected to find transfer to school-related tasks, as 
compared to typically developing children, children with ADHD might suffer from 
restriction in school-related performance due to their ADHD symptoms. Unfortunately, we 
found transfer to neither matrix reasoning nor school-related tasks. The failure to observe 
group differences could reflect the fact that children with ADHD struggle with attention, 
which is strongly required in tests of matrix reasoning, math, and reading ability. Although 
we were able to increase attention as a result of our cognitive training, it’s possible that we 
did not increase it enough. The levels achieved by these children with ADHD were lower 
than those typically achieved by children without ADHD and even certainly lower than 
typical adult performance. Perhaps with a longer training regimen, transfer to reasoning and 
school-related skills could be achieved in children with ADHD. Another possible 
explanation is that performance on the achievement measures require more crystalized 
knowledge compared to the measures for which we did find effects. As our intervention did 
not target crystalized knowledge, it is perhaps unsurprising that we did not find 
improvements in those areas.
Although we found transfer to objective measures of executive functioning, namely 
inhibition and, to some extent, working memory, we found no transfer to parent-reported 
executive functioning symptoms of ADHD. One explanation for this lack of transfer may be 
that, though laboratory and behavioral mesures are related in untrained populations, these 
relationships are no longer present following training (for example, if participants are 
learning strategies effective for laboratory tasks that may not apply to everyday behavior). 
Alternatively, it is possible that there was not enough improvement in inhibition to yield 
noticeable impact on parent reports of behavior. This second interpretation is consistent with 
our finding that training gain is correlated with the parent ratings; if training gains were 
larger, it is possible we would have seen significant improvements in parent ratings. If so, a 
more effective or longer-term n-back intervention may be necessary to see significant 
improvements in behavior.
Although the small effect sizes demonstrated here must necessarily temper the interpretation 
of these findings, the highlight of this study is the finding that sustained attention and 
inhibitory control can be improved via n-back training. This has the potential to be beneficial Jones et al. Page 14

"for children with ADHD who struggle with inhibition, attention, and hyperactivity. An 
added benefit of this intervention, compared to CWMT and behavioral therapies, is that it 
can be completed at home in the absence of a trained professional and can be easily 
distributed at minimal cost to families of children who struggle with ADHD. Additionally, 
this study has much to offer theoretically: It provides support for the theory that inhibitory 
control underlie issues associated with ADHD, namely inattention and hyperactivity. It also 
offers theoretical support for cognitive training more broadly, and provides insight into the 
relationship between training gains and transfer.
Limitations
The present study contributes to understanding of cognitive training and to our efforts of 
ameliorating the difficulties associated with ADHD. However, we acknowledge that our 
study has limitations. Specifically, outcome measures were all either lab based or parent 
report. Lab-based measures often lack in ecological validity and thus have limited bearing 
on everyday life, although the CPT used in our study has been shown to be highly predictive 
to ADHD symptomatology ( Perugini, Harvey, Lovejoy, Sandstrom, & Webb, 2000 ). Parent 
report, on the other hand, is rooted in everyday experiences with the child. Thus, parent 
report measures offer a great deal of ecological validity and clinical relevance, but may not 
be fully objective. Future work should include more objective assessments of whether 
improvements resulting from n-back training impact the child’s behavior at school or in the 
home. Another issue was attrition and dropout. Twenty-one participants (20.79%) did not 
complete the training or failed to adhere to the training schedule, a rate that seems high on 
first sight, however, it is lower than what has been reported in studies using similar 
interventions with non-ADHD samples (e.g., Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Shah, & Jonides, 2014 ; 
Redick et al., 2013 ) Importantly however, the excluded participants did not vary 
systematically from the included participants; alleviating concerns regarding selection bias 
(see Table 2).
Conclusion
The present study introduced n-back training as a potential cognitive intervention for 
children with ADHD. Children with ADHD who completed the training demonstrated 
improved inhibitory control relative to their peers in the control condition as assessed by lab-
based measures. Our findings have significant implications given that models of ADHD 
consider inhibitory control to be an underlying core deficit in ADHD ( Barkley, 1997 ). 
Additionally, the training group’s marginally significant reduction in parent-reported 
symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity has practical relevance: Our data suggest that 
improving inhibitory control via n-back training may result in decreased ADHD symptoms. 
Finally, unlike other cognitive interventions that require a trained clinician or researcher to 
administrator the training, ours was done at home by participants and supervised by parents 
in an ecologically valid setting. We chose at-home training rather than a laboratory-based 
training because we wanted to capitalize on one of the primary advantages of computerized 
cognitive training over or in conjunction with pharmacological or behavioral interventions, 
namely, that it can be easily distributed and inexpensively deployed. Thus, our findings offer Jones et al. Page 15

What does good, effective parenting look like? In my many decades of research and clinical practice with all
kinds of families touched by ADHD, a few key principles have surfaced time and time again.
Raising happy, healthy children with ADHD comes down to these core actions: accepting your child for who they
are, setting them up to succeed with their unique abilities in mind, and understanding that mistakes – on your
part and your child’s – are inevitable.
Keys to Good ADHD Parenting
1. Stop Trying to Change Your Child
You cannot engineer ADHD out of your child.
ADHD is far more than just being inattentive and/or restless. It is a neurodevelopmental disorder of self-
regulation that disrupts all seven executive functions. It is also largely genetic and biological. These factors
make ADHD a very impairing disorder, as we need self-regulation in just about every aspect of life. At the same
time, ADHD is among the most treatable disorders – bar none.
You have been blessed with a neurodivergent child. Since your child cannot change or be “redesigned” into
someone else, you must be the one to change your expectations. Realizing this sooner rather than later can
mitigate lots of undue conflict with your child and open the pathway to a positive parent-child relationship.
[Read: How to Process and Accept Your Child’s Neurodiversity]
Begin by identifying and celebrating your child’s strengths. What does your child love to do? Where do they
excel? Whether your child shows interest in music, sports, culinary arts, or entrepreneurship, validate their
aptitudes, no matter how unusual, unique, or nontraditional. Help them pursue their interests to the max –
make changes to your schedules, if possible, so that your child can further develop their talents. Look for area
resources that can further promote your child’s aptitudes. Advocate for your child unconditionally in their
efforts; tough love doesn’t work!
2. Mitigate Executive Function ImpairmentsCelebrating 25 Years",paper10.pdf,1
"ADHD impairs executive functioning, or the several brain-based skills we may take for granted in everyday life,
like our ability to plan and our working memory. Find ways to help your child compensate for these deficits to
reduce their degree of impairment.
Tim e blindness is one executive dysfunction that many families overlook. If your child struggles with meeting
deadlines, doing things in timed intervals, planning, anticipating future needs, and even practicing patience,
it’s because they struggle with the concept of time – something inherent to ADHD. To help a child with time
blindness, try the following:
Minimize delays. All of the arrangements in our life can be described in E-R-Os: Events that need to be
addressed, Responses to prepare for them, and Outcomes or consequences from them. These
arrangements happen over time, and they are usually not close together. The larger the space between
these events, the more we have to rely on executive functioning to keep track. To fix this, we can
artificially shorten the delays between EROs. One way is by breaking down tasks into shorter time frames.
Externalize time. Make time physical by using timers, clocks, counters or other devices that show the
passage of time, and how fast time is passing.
[Q&A: My Child Has No Concept of Time!]
W orking m em ory is another skill impaired in ADHD. It allows us to hold information in the mind and act on
what we know. Poor working memory creates a performance problem, wherein the issue is not with not knowing
what to do, but with actually doing it. You may be tempted to help your child with this issue by providing them
with more prompts, but this is not the answer. It is better instead to provide supports to help them recall and
use the skills they actually have. As with time blindness, you can help by externalizing information and
offloading it from their heads:
Use sticky notes, index cards, pictures, and other sequence cues to physically represent information
Encourage your child to use paper journals, take notes, and create to-do lists
Use lists and charts for important rules, reminders, and schedules
Rehearse “when-then” plans to help prime their recall of what to do
3. Expect Mistakes
Understand that you are going to make a lot of mistakes in raising your child – and that’s OK. We all make
mistakes. (I made mistakes in raising my kids, and I’m supposed to be an expert psychologist!) There is no such
thing as the perfect parent, and that’s not our goal.
What really matters, research shows, is being a coping parent – a parent who might make mistakes, but who
apologizes, asks for forgiveness, and strives to do better the next tim e around.
All that’s left, then, is to openly practice forgiveness. It helps to get rid of the vindictiveness, spitefulness,
anger, and hurt that builds up over time. So forgive yourself for occasional screw-ups. Forgive others who
misjudge your child and your parenting. Forgive your child for their mistakes – they will likely make more than
the average neurotypical child. Do away with framing their mistakes in moral or judgmental terms, and
recognize that it’s just part of the disorder. Approach their mishaps instead from a place of compassion, and
model for them what it means to try to get it right the next time.
Make forgiving your child easier by creating positive moments with them. If necessary, create a ritual around
restoring a positive view of your child. It may be looking at a favorite photo of your child at their best or
watching them as they sleep peacefully and soundly.",paper10.pdf,2

Teaching Strategies for Stude nts with ADHD: Ideas to Help
Every Child Shine
Your childʼs teacher is your partner in a fair and equitable education, but does she have the ADHD
tools she needs? The following ADHD teaching strategies will help all students — but especially those
with ADD — learn to the best of their ability in any classroom.

Parents: Is your child’s teacher doing everything possible to support learning? Teachers often dictate the
success or failure of a child’s education — particularly if that child has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD or ADD).
Next to parents, teachers are the most influential people in a student’s life. The best teacher will develop ADHD
strategies to show students that they are capable and worthwhile.
Here are some strategies for teaching children with ADHD that work to establish a supportive, structured
classroom that will encourage learning, enforce discipline, and boost self-esteem.
Strategies for Students with ADHD
Assign w ork that suits the student’s skill level. Students with ADHD will avoid classwork that is too
difficult or too long.
Off er choices. Children with ADHD who are given choices for completing an activity produce more work,
are more compliant, and act less negative. Establish, for instance, a list of 15 activity choices for
practicing spelling words like writing words on flash cards, using them in a sentence, or air-writing
words.
[Get This Download: How to Teach Children with ADHD — Classroom Challenges & Solutions]
Provide visual rem inders. Students with ADHD respond well to visual cues and examples. For instance,
demonstrate a skill like essay writing on an overhead projector or on the board. When children get to
their independent work, leave key points about a topic visible on the board. Post important concepts the
children will use again and again on brightly colored poster board around the room.
Increase active class participation. Group strategies include asking students to write their answers on
dry-erase white boards and showing them to the teacher, asking students to answer questions in unison
(choral response), having students give a thumbs up or down if the answer to the question is yes or no —
a level palm, if they don’t know the answer. Paired learning is also effective. Have students work through
a problem in a group and discuss for maximized understanding.Celebrating 25 Years",paper11.pdf,1
"Encourage hands-on learning. Create learning opportunities where children experience things first-
hand. Have students write and act out a play, record an assignment on videotape or take apart and put
together a model of a miniature eyeball when studying the human body.
Establish Rules & Routines for ADHD Students
Post classroom  rules for student w ith and w ithout ADH D. With input from students, establish short,
simple classroom rules. State them in positive terms that convey what you want students to do.
For example, instead of saying: “No loud talking when you come into class,” say, “When you come
into class, check the assignment on the board and start working quietly.” Or, “Sit down first and
then you may talk quietly with your neighbor until I start teaching.”
[Click to Download: 10 Teaching Strategies that Help Students with ADHD]
Establish classroom  routines. This will help students with ADHD stay on task. Routines for all students
can include: homework always being written on the board, “row captains” checking to see that
assignments are written and that completed work is picked up, etc. Students with ADHD can check in
with the classroom aide at the end of the day to make sure they understand the homework assignment
and what’s required of them.
Give appropriate supervision to ADH D students. Children with ADHD require more supervision than
their peers because of their delayed maturity, forgetfulness, distractibility, and disorganization. Help
these students by pairing them with classmates who can remind them of homework and classwork, using
student partners to team up on a project, and involving classroom aides as much as you can during and
after class.
Offer Accommodations for ADHD in the Classroom
Some students with ADHD may need school accommodations to address academic challenges. Make sure they
get them. Some accommodations can be as easy as monitoring the student’s work and developing a plan to help
him not fall behind and even accepting the occasional late assignment — this can give the student confidence
and get her back on track.
Other common ADHD accommodations include:
Extended time on tests
Shortened assignments
Instruction in note-taking or designating a class notetaker
Segmented assignments for long-term projects (with separate due dates and grades).
The Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA) makes the following recommendations for accommodations:
Reduce potential distractions. Always seat students who have problems with focus near the source of
instruction and/or stand near student when giving instructions in order to help the student by reducing
barriers and distractions between him and the lesson. Always seat this student in a low-distraction work
area in the classroom.
Use positive peer m odels. Encourage the student to sit near positive role models to ease the distractions
from other students with challenging or diverting behaviors.
Prepare for transitions. Remind the student about what is coming next (next class, recess, time for a
different book, etc.). For special events like field trips or other activities, be sure to give plenty of advance",paper11.pdf,2
"notice and reminders. Help the student in preparing for the end of the day and going home, supervise the
student’s book bag for necessary items needed for homework.
Allow  for m ovem ent. Allow the student to move around or fidget, preferably by creating reasons for the
movement. Provide opportunities for physical action — do an errand, wash the blackboard, get a drink of
water, go to the bathroom, etc. If this is not practical, then permit the student to play with small objects
kept in their desks that can be manipulated quietly, such as a soft squeeze ball, if it isn’t too distracting.
Let the children play. Recess can actually promote focus in children with ADHD so don’t use it as a time
to make-up missed schoolwork or as punishment as you might for other students.
Focus on the Positive
Establish a positive relationship w ith students w ho have ADH D. Greet them by name as they enter the
classroom or when calling on them in class. Create a class bulletin board for posting students’ academic
and extracurricular interests, photographs, artwork, and/or accomplishments.
Provide frequent, positive feedback. Students with ADHD respond best to feedback that is immediate.
Use positive praise, such as “You’re doing a great job” or “Now you’ve got it.” If a student’s answer is
incorrect, say, “Let’s talk this through” or “Does that sound right to you?”
Ask questions rather than reprim and. If the student misbehaves, in class, ask, “Is that a good choice or a
bad choice?” The student will get the message that his behavior is inappropriate.
Partner with Parents
For best results, teachers must partner with the parents to ensure that their child is ready to learn in the
classroom. Here are some guidelines to share with the parents of your students with ADHD:
Communicate regularly with the teacher about problems.
See that your child’s ADHD medication is working effectively at school and during homework sessions.
Help your child organize papers for evening homework and prepare for the next school day.
Watch your child put completed homework in the proper folder.
Monitor completion of work in the classes that he is in danger of failing.
Save all completed homework until the semester is over.
Talk with the teacher about using a daily or weekly report, if needed.

Attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common
neurodevelopmental disorders among children. Working memory deﬁcits underlie
many of the behavioural symptoms of ADHD. Alongside psychostimulant medications,
strategies to improve working memory may play an important adjuvant role in
the management of ADHD. In this study, we review the role of working memory
deﬁcits in ADHD, the evidence surrounding working memory training strategies in the
management of the condition, and the factors affecting the success of these strategies
in alleviating ADHD symptoms. More speciﬁcally, we review several non-pharmacological
interventions that target working memory deﬁcits in ADHD, with special emphasis on
cognitive working memory training. We conclude that the development of evidence-
based interventions such as computerised cognitive training (CCT) could provide an
alternative or adjunct to the use of psychostimulants, especially in cases where side
effects are a major issue.

INTRODUCTION
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental
disorders among children (Benyakorn et al., 2016). It is a chronic disorder with a complex and
heterogeneous clinical presentation (Kofler et al., 2019), including age-inappropriate and impairing
levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Franke et al., 2018).
The worldwide prevalence of ADHD among children and adolescents is 7.2% (Wolraich et al.,
2019) and among adults is between 2% and 5% (Polyzoi et al., 2018). Different etiological factors
and numerous prenatal risk factors are associated with ADHD, including maternal substance use,
stress during pregnancy, prematurity, low birth weight, and several complications of pregnancy,
labour, delivery, and infancy (Sciberras et al., 2017).

"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
ADHD affects children of both sexes, but males are diagnosed
with ADHD more frequently than females, with a male to female
ratio of 2–4:1 (Wolraich et al., 2019). These differences may
be attributable to hyperactive behaviour being more apparent
in males (Wolraich et al., 2019). Conversely, females are
more prone to receive a diagnosis of the inattentive subtype
of ADHD (Magnus et al., 2021). Although the disorder is
classically thought of as a developmental disorder, most children
diagnosed with ADHD will continue to experience symptoms
during adolescence and into adulthood (Gallo and Posner,
2016). Persistent ADHD is associated with multiple negative
consequences including academic underachievement, substance
abuse, risky sexual behaviour, car accidents and injuries, unstable
peer relationships (Bélanger et al., 2018), decreased community
functioning, unemployment, and reduced income (Holbrook
et al., 2016; Danielson et al., 2018).
Additionally, ADHD may present with other comorbid
disorders including anxiety (Lopez et al., 2018), depression
(Lopez et al., 2018), autism spectrum disorders (ASD),
oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and conduct disorder
(Franke et al., 2018). Mortality is also high in people with ADHD
(Bélanger et al., 2018).
The diagnosis of ADHD remains challenging due to a lack
of symptom specificity, a broad list of differential diagnoses,
and the presence of comorbidities (Bélanger et al., 2018). For
these reasons, a comprehensive and detailed clinical assessment
is particularly important (Bélanger et al., 2018).
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), there are three types
of ADHD: predominantly inattentive, predominantly
hyperactive/impulsive, and the combined type (Lopez
et al., 2018). A similar definition was recommended by the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). There are
differences in the age of onset and the necessary number of
symptoms for diagnosis (Lopez et al., 2018). To diagnose a child
with ADHD, the child must present with six out of the nine
symptoms on the two sets of core domains (inattention and
hyperactivity/impulsivity) as described in DSM-5. In youths and
adults, only five of these symptoms are necessary for diagnosis.
The symptoms must be observed for at least 6 months and cause
substantial impairment in social, academic, and occupational
performance in two or more different settings (e.g., home and
school).
The age of onset of ADHD symptoms was raised from 7 years
(DSM-4) to 12 years (DSM-5) to allow further flexibility in
diagnosing older adolescents and adults (Wolraich et al., 2019).
The symptoms of inattention include an inability to maintain
focus on details, making imprudent mistakes, an inability to stay
focused on duties, appearing to not listen when being spoken to,
an inability to adhere to directions or arrange tasks, keeping away
from duties that need mental exertion, losing important things,getting preoccupied with external stimuli, and being careless in
everyday activities. The symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity
include: squirming, feeling as if being continuously driven by
an ‘‘inward engine,’’ an inability to stay seated when required,
jumping on things, being noisy, exclaiming answers, blabbering,
an inability to wait their turn, and a tendency to hinder or
interrupt others. Because each of these symptoms has a different
underlying neurological substrate, it is possible that different
neurobiological mechanisms contribute to the clinical features of
ADHD ( Table 1 ).
Medications are essential for the management of patients
with ADHD (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2014). Psychostimulants
are considered the first-line pharmacological treatment option
for ADHD (Lambez et al., 2020), with methylphenidate
being the most prescribed psychostimulant. Methylphenidate
can enhance cognitive function in patients with ADHD and
improve cerebral cortex activity by increasing the availability
of catecholamines, which play a critical role in cognitive
functioning (Farr et al., 2014). However, the use of stimulants
increases the risk of anorexia, weight loss, and insomnia
(Briars and Todd, 2016).
Non-pharmacological interventions have also been
investigated for improving cognitive function in ADHD
(Sharma et al., 2015). Dietary supplementation with minerals
and Omega-3 resulted in modest improvements in ADHD
behavioural symptoms and emotional lability (Sharma et al.,
2015). Meditation-based practices such as yoga and mindfulness
are commonly practised in patients with ADHD (Sharma
et al., 2015). Yoga has been found to modulate the activity of
the autonomic nervous system and induce parasympathetic
activity and thus improve anxiety and mood. It also reduces
impulsive behaviour (Sharma et al., 2015). Mindfulness
increases the density of grey matter in areas associated with
memory, emotion control, and learning (Sharma et al., 2015).
However, there are substantial differences between studies in
the methods and the targeted ADHD subtypes and deficits,
and hence these conclusions remain to be corroborated
(Sharma et al., 2015).
Another promising non-pharmacological approach is
neurofeedback (NFB; Ros et al., 2014). It improves self-control
by using a brain-computer interface and improves behavioural
symptoms of ADHD for up to 1 year after treatment (Van Doren
et al., 2019). NFB training also improves visual and auditory
short-term memory and auditory working memory (Nesayan
et al., 2019).
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is another
non-pharmacological approach that can be implemented
on an individual or group basis, or for parental education
(Shabanpour et al., 2017). Previous studies have shown that
CBT reduces the behavioural symptoms of ADHD (Shabanpour
et al., 2017). In addition, there is evidence for other non-invasive,

"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
non-pharmacological interventions that can be offered to ADHD
patients such as physical exercise, transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS), and transcranial magnetic stimulation
(TMS) to improve the behavioural and cognitive domains of
ADHD (Lambez et al., 2020). However, there are relatively few
studies in this field (Lambez et al., 2020).
The combination of non-pharmacological and
pharmacological interventions seems promising for achieving
improved cognitive function with lower medication doses, thus
potentially reducing side effects. These non-pharmacological
interventions target cognitive domains considered central to the
cognitive deficits in ADHD, most notably working memory.
Moreover, these interventions provide benefits beyond what
is achievable through medication alone (Holmes et al., 2010;
Catalá-López et al., 2017). Thus, training exercises targeting
working memory are a promising adjunct treatment option for
people with ADHD.
In this review, we provide a review of working memory and
working memory training and their role in the management of
ADHD. We provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying
the therapeutic benefit of working memory training and identify
novel directions for research to improve ADHD treatment
protocols.
WORKING MEMORY
Working memory refers to the active mental workspace that
can briefly hold and manipulate information (Fang et al., 2016).
Working memory capacity determines the rate and level of
learning and predicts performance on mental tasks such as
reading comprehension, language acquisition, reasoning, and
problem-solving (Fang et al., 2016; Emch et al., 2019).
Working memory is a hierarchical process that connects
detailed sensory representations to specific behavioural
responses. These are linked viaintermediate task-relevant
representations and action plans in a network of different brain
areas (Christophel et al., 2017).
Working memory plays a fundamental role in cognition,
allowing one to hold information ‘‘in mind.’’ Working memory
is defined by its flexibility: people are capable of storing, at least
temporarily, any information. According to Baddeley’s multi-
element model of working memory, considered the predominant
hypothetical model (Baddeley, 2007), the working memory
system includes three anatomically and functionally discrete
elements:
1. The visuospatial sketchpad, that stores visual and spatial
material with limited capacity (Emch et al., 2019).
2. The phonological loop, which has two components. The first
component, the phonological store, holds visually presented
and auditory-verbal information that can be kept active in the
second component, the articulatory loop, through subvocal
rehearsal (Emch et al., 2019).
3. The central executive, which allocates the attentional
resources for the organisation, deeper processing, and storage
of different types of information elements and is considered
the master element of working memory (Emch et al., 2019).The episodic buffer integrates information from the phonological
loop, visuospatial sketchpad, and long-term memory (Emch
et al., 2019). The buffer is a passive system with limited
capacity, believed to be linked to long-term memory and
semantic meaning (Baddeley, 2017). Its main function is to
link information across different domains to form integrated
elements of visual, spatial, and verbal information that are
ordered in an episodic and chronological manner.
Working memory includes multiple stages: encoding,
maintenance, and retrieval, as well as some process of attention
regulation that resists interruption by irrelevant information
(Emch et al., 2019).
Encoding is the initial process of perceiving and learning
information. Working memory stores information for
immediate or long-term use (long-term memory). Encoding can
be visual (converting images and visual sensory information to
memory), elaborative (relating new information to previously
stored knowledge), semantic (processing and encoding sensory
input that has a particular meaning), acoustic (encoding auditory
inputs), or other (tactile, odours, tastes; Baddeley, 2017).
Maintenance (or storage) of information is the process of
placing the acquired information into memory. Memory can
be stored in short-term or long-term memory, with the former
being a component of working memory. Short-term memory is
only used to refer to the storage of information for a short while
and working memory refers to the components of memory that
uses the information to manipulate this information (Baddeley,
2017).
Retrieval is the mental process of recalling information that
was previously stored. There are three main types of recall: free,
cued, and serial. Free recall occurs when individuals are asked to
recall items previously presented on a list. Cued recall is when a
person receives a list of items to remember and is then offered
cues to help them recall those items during testing. Serial recall
refers to recalling events or items in the order in which they
occurred (Baddeley, 2017).
NEURAL CORRELATES OF WORKING
MEMORY
Early studies that used resting-state functional magnetic imaging
(fMRI) have shown that large-scale brain regions exhibit
high-amplitude fluctuations, which are enhanced during rest
and reduced during cognitive tasks (Konrad and Eickhoff,
2010; Castellanos and Proal, 2012). This intrinsic functional
inter-neuronal connection represents the brain’s physiological
reference and the so-called default mode network (DMN; Konrad
and Eickhoff, 2010; Castellanos and Proal, 2012). The DMN
involves the anterior medial prefrontal cortex (amPFC), the
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), the medial temporal lobe
(MTL) subsystem, and the dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) subsystem
(Castellanos and Proal, 2012).
The executive control network (ECN), also known as
the frontoparietal network, includes the dorsolateral PFC
(dlPFC), anterior PFC (aPFC), anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), lateral frontal pole, lateral cerebellum, anterior insula,
caudate, and inferior parietal lobe (Konrad and Eickhoff, 2010;
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 686873",paper12.pdf,3
"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
Castellanos and Proal, 2012). This circuit has been defined as the
task-positive circuit as it shows more activity during tasks than
during rest (Konrad and Eickhoff, 2010). It also directs decision
making by incorporating exterior stimuli with the corresponding
interior representations (Castellanos and Proal, 2012). The DMN
and ECN are inversely correlated as the activation of the ECN is
associated with lower activity of the DMN and vice versa (Konrad
and Eickhoff, 2010).
The dorsal attentional network includes the intraparietal
sulcus and frontal eye fields, which are essential in attention
shifting and control (Castellanos and Proal, 2012). The ventral
attentional network, also known as the salience network
(SN), involves the fronto-insular cortex (FIC), temporoparietal
junction and supramarginal gyrus (Castellanos and Proal, 2012).
The visual network includes the visual cortex and lateral
temporal region MT+, which is linked to DAN viathe superior
parietal lobule and intraparietal cortex (IPC). MT+ also is
connected with frontal areas (Castellanos and Proal, 2012). The
occipital cortex, which contains most of the visual cortex regions,
interacts with DAN to hold attention and suppress attention to
the distractor (Castellanos and Proal, 2012). The motor network
involves simultaneous spontaneous low-amplitude fluctuations
between the supplementary motor cortex, primary motor cortex,
primary and secondary sensory cortex, putamen, cerebellum,
thalamus, and ventral premotor cortex (Castellanos and Proal,
2012). These fundamental networks can be investigated in
ADHD and other neurocognitive disorders (Castellanos and
Proal, 2012).
Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that
working memory is related to the prefrontal cortex (PFC),
inferior and middle temporal lobes, and zones close to the IPC
(Fang et al., 2016). Similarly, these regions are linked to cognitive
function, PLL, declarative memory, and episodic processing
(Fang et al., 2016). Moreover, working memory task-based fMRI
studies have shown that information encoding and manipulation
is related to dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC). Error recognition and
execution adjustment, on the other hand, are related to activity in
the dorsal ACC (dACC), which is considered to be the attention
organiser (Chai et al., 2018). Information selection, retrieval, and
inhibition regulation are linked to neurons extending from the
ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) to the anterior insula (Fang et al.,
2016). The left PFC and the right PFC might be primarily
associated with verbal working memory and spatial working
memory, respectively, as indicated in previous meta-analyses
(Emch et al., 2019). However, there is no common agreement
on the functional organisation of this brain region (Emch et al.,
2019).
fMRI studies have also proposed that the articulatory loop is
linked to Broca’s area, premotor cortex (BA6), supplementary
motor area, and insula on the left hemisphere. The phonological
store is linked to BA 40, relating to the inferior parietal lobule
in the left hemisphere (Emch et al., 2019). Hence these areas
are critical for all kinds of visual working memory tasks (Emch
et al., 2019). The cerebellum has been suggested to be involved
in subvocal rehearsal (Emch et al., 2019). Similarly, the basal
ganglia (BG) are essential brain structures involved in motor
control, facilitating appropriate motor behaviour and inhibitinginappropriate motor behaviour (Emch et al., 2019). The BG
is also involved in working memory and language production
(Emch et al., 2019). Furthermore, visual working memory is
related to parts of the limbic system such as the cingulate
(Emch et al., 2019). However, the contribution of the cerebellum,
BG, and limbic system to working memory has long been
undervalued (Emch et al., 2019).
In addition, studies that used resting-state fMRI have revealed
that working memory functioning is related to resting-state
neuronal activity (Fang et al., 2016). For example, Hampson
et al. (2010), reported that working memory accuracy was
related to the coherent neuronal interconnection between
the dlPFC and medial PFC (Hampson et al., 2010; Fang
et al., 2016). However, such complex cognitive functions are
characterised by cooperation between multiple brain areas
rather than being driven by one or two regions (Fang et al.,
2016). Furthermore, the individual disparities in working
memory are related to the efficient functional connection
from dlPFC to Dacc and from the right dlPFC to the left
FIC. The high sensitivity of left FIC to inputs from dlPFC
assists in efficient manipulation of information and hence
improved working memory functioning during working memory
tasks (Fang et al., 2016).
Moreover, diffusion MRI in healthy individuals has also
demonstrated that working memory capacity is linked to a
corticocortical pathway between the frontal and parietal regions.
In addition, the updating of working memory information
included a subcortical neural pathway linking between frontal
and parietal regions through the thalamus and BG (Ekman et al.,
2016). Moreover, working memory capacity is directly correlated
to the integrity of white matter in frontal and parietal regions on
diffusion MRI (Ekman et al., 2016).
COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN ADHD
Although many cognitive targets have been investigated
in ADHD (see Table 2 ), this review focuses on working
memory. Working memory deficits are an important potential
endophenotype of ADHD (Kasper et al., 2012; Chacko et al.,
2013). The earliest model of the neuropsychological correlate of
ADHD was the prefrontal-striatal-cerebellar model (Castellanos
and Proal, 2012).
Animal Studies
Animal models of ADHD show good predictive validity that
allows the assessment and development of new therapeutic
interventions. For example, they have shown polymorphism in
several genes related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission.
These include the dopamine transporter (DAT), dopamine
D4 receptor (DRD4), and dopamine beta-hydroxylase genes.
A lack of DAT results in decreased release of dopamine
from the nerve terminal, which is accompanied by a fivefold
increase in the concentration of extracellular dopamine.
On the presynaptic side, mRNA and D1 and D2 receptor
protein levels in the BG decrease. Compounds such as
amphetamine, methylphenidate, and cocaine have a direct action
on DATs and inhibit hyperactivity (Rahi and Kumar, 2021).

While studies with transgenic mice have provided valuable
information on the neurobiological factors underlying ADHD,
no single gene or transgenic animal model represents the

as well gene-environment interactions must also be taken
into account.
Human Studies
Recent studies propose that working memory deficits occur in
approximately 80–85% of children with ADHD when evaluated
with cognitive tasks (Coghill et al., 2014; Karalunas et al., 2017;
Kofler et al., 2018a, 2020). Studies have also shown that children
with ADHD have more working memory deficits than typically
developing children (Kasper et al., 2012). Several studies have
shown that children diagnosed with ADHD are impaired in all
working memory elements, with the most significant impairment
found in the central executive, resulting in an inability to focus on
a task (Kofler et al., 2010).
Working memory deficits have been linked with inattention
(Kofler et al., 2010), hyperactivity (Hudec et al., 2015), and
impulsivity (Raiker et al., 2012). They have been associated with
ADHD-related impairment in academics (Friedman et al., 2018),
organisational (Kofler et al., 2018b), social (Bunford et al., 2015),
and family life (Kofler et al., 2017). Longitudinal studies show
that less severe working memory deficits are associated with
lower symptom severity (Halperin et al., 2008; van Lieshout et al.,
2016; Salari et al., 2017), and reductions in ADHD symptoms
with age seem to be limited to a subset of children who show
improvements in working memory over time (Karalunas et al.,
2017). These studies highlight the significant influence that
working memory has on the symptomatology of many children
with ADHD and have motivated a recent surge in studies aiming
to enhance working memory in children with ADHD (Kofler
et al., 2018a).NEURAL CORRELATES OF ADHD
Functional neuroimaging studies using specific or multiple
cognitive tasks in ADHD patients have found widespread
multiregional dysfunctions. These include the lateral PFC and
its connection to the BG, medio- and orbitofrontal regions,
and the cingulate cortex. In addition, dissociation in neural
connectivity in the frontoparietal, fronto-limbic and fronto-
cerebellar networks have also been observed.
A meta-analysis of fMRI studies that were conducted on
ADHD patients ( n= 111) and controls ( n= 113), revealed
a reduction in neural activity in superior and middle PFC
in both hemispheres, as well as the medial frontal cortex
and ACC in the left hemisphere. A recent functional MRI
study investigated more than 100 children and adults with
ADHD using a visual-spatial working memory task. It showed
two separate effects according to working memory demand:
enhancement of neural activity in the inferior prefrontal
cortex (IFC) under high working memory demand and a
reduction in neural activity in IFC under low working memory
demand (Rubia, 2018).
WORKING MEMORY TRAINING
Working memory training aims to improve working memory
through a series of tasks that help the trainee engage and
practice this cognitive function. Prevalent are computerised
cognitive training (CCT) interventions, which can provide
training in a wide range of cognitive tasks (e.g., working
memory, attention, inhibitory control) in multiple training
sessions over several weeks, often in a game format design
(Table 3 ). The duration and number of sessions differ according
to each specific implemented program (Veloso et al., 2019).
CCT is described as adaptive when the level of task difficulty

2010). These products have similar goals but differ in the
extent to which they include elements like acquiring points,
providing feedback, representing skill progression, accumulating
rewards, and framing the training within a narrative context
(Oldrati et al., 2020).
The Cogmed Working Memory Training program (CWMT,
Pearson, UK) has become the most popular and widely studied
CCT program, and it has both supporters and detractors
(Shinaver et al., 2014; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2014). The program
consists of sessions of working memory tasks in the form of
simple games on a computer or tablet. The training sessions take
around 45–50 min to complete, 5 days per week, over 5 weeks,
with weekly rewards. The complexity of the tasks is automatically
adjusted based on the person’s performance.EFFECTS OF WORKING MEMORY
TRAINING
In this section, we discuss the evidence for the efficacy of working
memory training in the general population, which helps us
understand its potential role in ADHD management. Figure 1
provides an overview of the potential mechanisms to improve
working memory.
Two general mechanisms explain the effects of working
memory training (von Bastian and Oberauer, 2014). The first
is increased working memory capacity , which enables people to
hold more items in their working memory, and the second is
increased efficiency in using available working memory capacity.
At the behavioural level, an increase in working memory
capacity results in performance improvements in tasks on which
the person was not trained, but that share some variance with
the training tasks (Klingberg, 2010). Given that working memory
capacity significantly correlates with several cognitive abilities,
these improvements should manifest in several measures which
are independent of the precise materials and structure of the tasks
(Schmiedek et al., 2010). In general, two terms are used to define
the transfer of training: (1) near-transfer which refers to gains in
abilities directly related to the training task; and (2) far-transfer,
which are gains in different but related abilities.
Meiran, Dreisbach, and von Bastian noted in 2019 that while
meta-analyses assessing the existence of far-transfer benefits of
working memory training have found negative (Melby-Lervåg
et al., 2016), limited or short-lived positive results (Au et al.,
2015), performance gains on similar tasks are substantial, and
trainees typically performing above average after training. For
example, in one study, young adults could recall twice as many
items from a list as the average healthy adult after 20 sessions of
working memory training (von Bastian and Oberauer, 2014).
Understanding the neural correlates of training-induced
improvements would help guide and monitor training strategies.
However, this is challenging given the existence of many parallel
behavioural changes that occur during working memory training
(Klingberg, 2010). There are, however, studies that show a
positive correlation between working memory capacity and brain
activity in different task-relevant areas. For example, inter-
individual differences in working memory capacity positively
correlate with activity in the IPC (Gray et al., 2003; Todd
and Marois, 2004; Vogel and Machizawa, 2004; Lee et al.,
2006; McNab and Klingberg, 2008) and increases in working
memory capacity during childhood are positively correlated with
brain activity in the prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus
(Klingberg et al., 2002; Kwon et al., 2002; Ciesielski et al., 2006;
Crone et al., 2006; Scherf et al., 2006; Olesen et al., 2007). On
the other hand, the decline in working memory during ageing
is associated with decreased activity in certain prefrontal areas
(Rajah and D’Esposito, 2005; Persson and Nyberg, 2006).
To assess the effects of working memory training on the
brain, most neuroimaging studies have relied on recording
changes in the activity of brain regions during working memory
task performance before and after training (Constantinidis
and Klingberg, 2016). Working memory training is associated
with changes in the neuronal activity of brain regions that

FIGURE 1 | (A) Proposed mechanism of cognitive ability enhancement using working memory training, as explained by von Bastian et al. (2013). (B)An
association-test map displaying brain regions that were consistently reported in 1091 studies investigating working memory. Working memory training engages
executive and dorsal attentional networks. This involves brain regions like dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate (AC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG),
and parietal regions. Map prepared using Neurosynth meta-analysis of the term working memory (Yarkoni et al., 2011). Similar neural networks show decreased

are activated during working memory tasks before training
(Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). This finding suggests
that improvements in task performance during working
memory training reflect improved working memory capacity
(Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016).
Earlier research with healthy adults using fMRI suggests that
working memory training has a direct effect on the prefrontal
cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and dopamine receptor binding.
Studies have shown that working memory training results in
enhanced neuronal activity in the prefrontal cortex and the
posterior parietal cortex, which are areas linked to working
memory processing (Green et al., 2012). Working memory
training also increases the density of D1 receptors in these brain
regions (Green et al., 2012) and increases activity in the striatum
(Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). Although this change in
striatal activity is not consistent, it is predictive of working
memory capacity changes during development (Constantinidis
and Klingberg, 2016).
Several studies of the brain’s functional connectivity have
shown that stronger functional connectivity between frontal and
parietal cortices plays a significant role in working memory
improvement with training (Constantinidis and Klingberg,
2016). A study using TMS of the parietal cortex during training
on higher-demand working memory tasks revealed stronger
functional connectivity between the frontal cortex and the
parietal cortex, and between the parietal cortex and the occipital
cortex (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). Furthermore,
a magnetoencephalography study of functional connectivity
changes during, before, and after working memory training
found increased connectivity between frontal, parietal and lateral
occipital cortex, which was associated with working memory
improvements (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016).
An increase in synaptic connection and myelin density
in axons connecting the involved regions might be the
mechanism underlying training-related functional connectivity
changes (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). As previouslymentioned, dopamine plays an important role during working
memory training (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). Positron
emission tomography studies in humans and other animals
have shown that working memory training results in changes
in the release of dopamine as well as the density of dopamine
receptors (Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). Changes in
striatal dopamine release might also enable cortical plasticity
(Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016).
WORKING MEMORY TRAINING IN ADHD
Several studies have provided evidence for the efficacy of working
memory training in ADHD. A meta-analysis of 54 studies
investigating a range of CCT programs (including most of the
ones mentioned above) showed that they were associated with
improvements in working memory, as well as other elements
of executive functioning, in people with ADHD (Veloso et al.,
2019). Importantly, the majority of studies involving longitudinal
follow-up showed that these improvements were maintained
over time.
The reason CWMT attracts more attention compared to
most other CCT programs likely stems from the fact that its
effectiveness has been established by several studies (Simons
et al., 2016). Furthermore, studies investigating the effects
of CWMT tend to have a better experimental design, often
including active controls. These randomised controlled trials of
CWMT provide strong evidence that it enhances performance
on other working memory tasks that have similar processing
demands. While other CCT programs have been shown to
improve working memory, evidence for this from randomised
controlled trials is often lacking. Furthermore, when randomised
controlled trials of these interventions are conducted, they are
often compared with passive control groups (Simons et al., 2016).
Due to its widespread use, popularity, and strong evidence for
its efficacy, the following section will focus on studies utilising
CWMT.
Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 686873",paper12.pdf,7
"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
Several studies have found significant clinical effects on
executive functions in ADHD individuals following CWMT
intervention ( Table 5 ). Klingberg et al. (2005) conducted the
first randomised controlled trial of CWMT in 53 children with
ADHD who were randomised to either adaptive (adjusted to
the user’s performance) or non-adaptive CWMT (not adjusted
to the user’s performance) This research showed that adaptive
CWMT resulted in significant improvement of working memory,
inhibition control, complex reasoning, and a reduction in
ADHD symptoms on the parent-rating scale; these effects were
maintained at a post-training 3 months follow-up. Gray et al.
(2012) evaluated the impact of CWMT on working memory in
a sample of 60 youth who were diagnosed with ADHD and
learning disability. The main finding was that CWMT improved
visuospatial working memory and visual working memory, and
also led to gains in attention, math, and reading.
Consistent with the findings of previous studies, Holmes
et al. (2010) found that CWMT produced significant clinical
effects in a sample of 25 children with ADHD, who were assessed
before and after training as well as on and off medication. The
researchers concluded that, although medication significantly
improved visuospatial working memory, CWMT led to
significant gains on multiple memory tasks such as visuospatial
working memory, visual working memory, visuospatial
short term memory, and verbal short term memory. Theimprovements lasted for at least 6 months after training and
were larger than the effect of the medication alone.
In a different study, Beck et al. (2010) found that children
with ADHD who underwent CWMT showed an improvement
in working memory and a reduction in inattention along with an
increase in positive behaviours compared to age-typical children
in the wait-list group. These improvements were still noticed by
their parents 4 months later. However, the study reported no
positive effects on hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms rated by
their patients and teachers (Beck et al., 2010). Similarly, Green
et al. (2012) reported that adaptive-CWMT in ADHD children
led to significant gains in working memory tasks, but there was
no effect on ADHD symptoms rated by the parents (Gray et al.,
2012).
There is some evidence regarding the beneficial effects of
CWMT on fluid intelligence, which may play a significant role
in educational achievement (Kaufman et al., 2009). Bergman
Nutley et al. (2011) found significant improvements on measures
of fluid intelligence in children who trained on a non-verbal
reasoning task. This finding was also replicated on working
memory training tasks other than CogMed (i.e., N-Back), and
lasted for at least 3 months post-training (Jaeggi et al., 2011).
Söderqvist and Bergman Nutley (2015) reported that CWMT in
typical learners led to higher academic achievement in math and
reading 2 years after training.

"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
Other studies have found less promising results with regards
to CWMT outcomes. These studies concluded that, although
CWMT led to improvements in certain aspects of working
memory and executive function, these improvements failed to
generalise to academic achievement (Chacko et al., 2013; Bigorra
et al., 2016). Similarly, a previous meta-analysis that examined
the effectiveness of cognitive training in children with ADHD
concluded that there is no significant effect of training on
the cognitive, behavioural, and/or academic abilities of these
children (Rapport et al., 2013). However, the researchers stated
that their findings might be due to methodological limitations
across the reviewed studies. In line with the previous meta-
analysis, Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013) reported that working
memory training resulted in short-term gains in working
memory skills, but these gains do not generalise to other skills
or persist for long periods.
With regards to the transfer effects of cognitive training,
it has been theorised that training-based improvements in
working memory capacity and attention generalise to other
functioning domains. However, the results across the literature
are inconsistent (Sala et al., 2019). CWMT has shown
near-transfer effects in children diagnosed with ADHD,
poor working memory, and/or attention deficits (Rossignoli-
Palomeque et al., 2018). Far-transfer effects were reported on
measures of reasoning and inhibition (Klingberg et al., 2005)
and executive function (Holmes et al., 2010; Bigorra et al., 2016).
Far-transfer effects were also reported on ADHD symptoms
(Beck et al., 2010; Bigorra et al., 2016) as well as on academic
abilities such as math (Holmes et al., 2010; Dahlin, 2013; Egeland
et al., 2013) and reading (Egeland et al., 2013). The effects of
training on near-transfer were short-lived, and on far-transfer
ranged from 4 to 8 months (Rossignoli-Palomeque et al., 2018).
The inconsistent results regarding the effectiveness of
cognitive training on improving ADHD cognition and behaviour
may reflect differences in training strategy (exact training
protocols, trained populations, concomitant treatment, etc). The
heterogeneity of training strategies used in previous studies may
itself reflect a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that
underlie the response (or lack thereof) to cognitive interventions.
FACTORS POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING
THE EFFECT OF WORKING MEMORY
TRAINING
Several factors are known to influence the outcomes of CCT
interventions, including characteristics of the training plan (such
as the intensity, duration, adaptivity of the training task), as
well as individual differences in age, cognitive abilities, biological
factors, personality factors, motivational factors, and emotional
factors (von Bastian and Oberauer, 2014; Barkus, 2020; Dentz
et al., 2020). Awareness of the role of these factors may help
optimise CCT strategies in the future.
Characteristics of the Training Plan
Most commercially available CCT programs target a mix of
different cognitive skills. While this was thought to lead to more
transfer effects than targeting single skills, empirical evidence forthis – in the form of comprehensive direct comparisons between
these strategies – is lacking. The little evidence that is available in
this regard suggests that programs that provide intensive practise
of one aspect of a cognitive function like working memory are
probably more effective at achieving transfer effects than those
that involve multiple cognitive skills (von Bastian et al., 2013).
There is considerable heterogeneity in the CCT literature
regarding the number and duration of training sessions (Luis-
Ruiz et al., 2020; Wiest et al., 2020; Grinberg et al., 2021).
Importantly, few studies have attempted to directly determine
the optimal length and intensity of CCT. Nonetheless, several
studies have shown that the effect of such interventions is
dose-dependent, meaning the length and intensity of these
programs influence outcomes (Jaeggi et al., 2008; Alloway et al.,
2013). Although many commercially available CCT products
implement this, the influence of adapting to the individual
trainee’s performance to maintain a level of difficulty that is
challenging on performance gains is also controversial (von
Bastian and Oberauer, 2014).
Characteristics of the Trainee
Several factors potentially contribute to the relatively high
between-person variability in performance gains and transfer
effects following working memory training. Working memory
training programs tend to generally be more effective in
younger than older individuals, with evidence suggesting that
the relationship between age and training is linear throughout
the lifespan (Wass et al., 2012; Melby-Lervåg and Hulme,
2013). Characteristics such as intrinsic motivation (finding
enjoyment or satisfaction in engaging in a particular behaviour)
are known to correlate with working memory performance
(Brose et al., 2010; Duckworth et al., 2011). Whether or not
such characteristics directly influence the performance gains
following CCT interventions has not yet been established. On the
other hand, personality traits like neuroticism (related to higher
excitability and emotional responsiveness) are associated with
lower performance gains after working memory training (Studer-
Luethi et al., 2012).
Twin studies show an estimated heritability of working
memory capacity of around 50% (Ando et al., 2001).
As previously mentioned, the importance of dopamine
in this context is evidenced by the finding that working
memory training increases dopaminergic receptor density
and dopaminergic pathway activity (Green et al., 2012;
Constantinidis and Klingberg, 2016). In addition, working
memory performance appears to be significantly influenced
by dopamine-relevant genes (Bäckman and Nyberg, 2013).
Carriers of the DAT1 9/10-repeat allele benefit more from
working memory training compared to carriers of the DAT1
10-repeat allele (Brehmer et al., 2012). This difference may be
explained by the fact that 10-repeat carriers have increased gene
expression, which leads to a higher level of dopamine reuptake,
and, consequently, fewer active dopaminergic pathways available
(Swanson et al., 2000).
Another genetic factor that contributes to the availability
of dopamine is the allelic variations in the LIM homeobox
transcription factor 1 alpha (LMX1A; Nakatani et al., 2010).

"Al-Saad et al. Working Memory Training in ADHD
A study conducted by Colzato et al. (2011) showed that
two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that influence the
number of dopamine neurons in the midbrain have a significant
relationship with verbal working memory training.
Finally, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which
is involved in hippocampal plasticity, may also have a role
in working memory training (Loprinzi and Frith, 2019).
One example of this is the Val66Met SNP in the BDNF
gene. In comparison to Val homozygotes, carriers with the
Met allele perform poorer in certain memory tasks (Hariri
et al., 2003) and have reduced hippocampal volume (Bueller
et al., 2006). A comparison of Val/Val homozygotes with
carriers of the Met allele (Colzato et al., 2011) showed that,
while both groups improved during CCT, only the Val/Val
homozygous individuals showed far-transfer to a divided
attention task.
DISCUSSION
ADHD has a complex and heterogeneous disorder and a one-
size-fits-it-all treatment approach is likely to provide limited
results in many cases. The present study provides a review of
the neurocognitive mechanisms that underlie changes in working
memory and how these mechanisms may influence the response
to working memory training.
Cognitive training programs that target working memory are
a potentially useful therapeutic option in ADHD. Response to
working memory training may reflect changes in the neuronalactivity of brain regions that are activated during working
memory tasks before training (Constantinidis and Klingberg,
2016) and multiple factors may explain individual differences in
response (Ando et al., 2001), such as the settings of the training
regime and several individual factors.
Given that working memory capacity significantly correlates
with several cognitive abilities, improvements in working
memory capacity should manifest in several measures which
are independent of the materials and structure of the tasks
(Schmiedek et al., 2010; Rosenberg et al., 2020). The possibility
of achieving near-transfer and far-transfer following working
memory training arguably adds additional support in favour of
researching and improving working memory training programs
for ADHD.
Although pharmacological interventions such as stimulants
provide a substantial improvement in ADHD cognitive
symptoms, this comes at the cost of a higher risk of side
effects. Cognitive training provides additional benefits above
and beyond those of pharmacological interventions in
ADHD, though additional studies of higher methodological
quality comparing these two treatment strategies are
necessary.

Abstract
Objective— Working memory deficits have been linked experimentally and developmentally with 
ADHD-related symptoms/impairments. Unfortunately, substantial evidence indicates that extant 
working memory training programs fail to improve these symptoms/impairments. We 
hypothesized that this discrepancy may reflect insufficient targeting, such that extant protocols do 
not adequately engage the specific working memory components linked with the disorder’s 
behavioral/functional impairments.
Method— The current study describes the development, empirical basis, and initial testing of 
central executive training (CET) relative to gold-standard behavioral parent training (BPT). 
Children with ADHD ages 8–13 ( M=10.43, SD=1.59; 21 girls; 76% Caucasian/Non-Hispanic) 
were treated using BPT ( n=27) or CET ( n=27). Detailed data analytic plans for the pre/post design 
were preregistered. Primary outcomes included phonological and visuospatial working memory, 
and secondary outcomes included actigraphy during working memory testing and two distal far-
transfer tasks. Multiple feasibility/acceptability measures were included.
Results— The BPT and CET samples did not differ on any pre-treatment characteristics. CET 
was rated as highly acceptable by children, and was equivalent to BPT in terms of feasibility/

Conflict of Interest: The principal investigator’s university has submitted a provisional patent application for central executive training 
(CET). There are no current licensing, financial, or other conflicts to report.
Data Transparency
Pretreatment data for the working memory tests was reported in MS1 (published) to investigate conceptually distinct hypotheses. The 
current manuscript reflects the first reporting of treatment outcome data for any children in this sample. A complete list of treatment 
data collected for this sample is included in Supplementary Table 1.

"acceptability as evidenced by parent-reported high satisfaction, low barriers to participation, and 
large ADHD symptom reductions. CET was superior to BPT for improving working memory 
(group x time d=1.06) as hypothesized. CET was also superior to BPT for reducing actigraph-
measured hyperactivity during visuospatial working memory testing and both distal far-transfer 
tasks (group x time d=0.74).
Conclusions— Results provide strong support for continued testing of CET and, if replicated, 
would support recent hypotheses that next-generation ADHD cognitive training protocols may 
overcome current limitations via improved targeting.
Working memory deficits are present in a substantial portion of children with attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; Kasper et al., 2012 ), and have been linked with core 
behavioral symptoms of inattention ( Kofler et al., 2010 ; Gathercole et al., 2008 ), 
hyperactivity ( Hudec et al., 2015 ; Rapport et al., 2009 ), and impulsivity ( Raiker et al., 2012 ). 
Working memory deficits covary longitudinally with ADHD symptom severity ( Halperin et 
al., 2008 ; Salari et al., 2017 ; van Lieshout et al., 2016 ), and age-related reductions in ADHD 
symptoms appear limited to a subset of children who show age-related improvements in 
working memory (Karalunas et al., in press). Further, working memory deficits in ADHD 
have been linked with ADHD-related impairments in academic ( Friedman et al., 2017 ), 
social (Bunford et al., 2014), organizational ( Kofler et al., 2017a ) and family functioning 
(Kofler et al., 2017b ).
Given this preponderance of evidence, the recent upsurge in attempts to improve working 
memory in pediatric ADHD is unsurprising. More surprising, however, is the inefficacy of 
these protocols, as documented in comprehensive meta-analyses of working memory 
training studies for children with ADHD ( Cortese et al., 2015 ; Rapport et al., 2013 ), 
neurotypical children ( Sala & Gobet, 2017 ), and diverse samples of children and adults 
(Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016 ; Shipstead et al., 2012 ). These independent reports uniformly 
conclude that the evidence supporting working memory training is limited to uncontrolled or 
under-controlled studies, is found almost exclusively for unblinded parent ratings ( Cortese et 
al., 2015 ; Rapport et al., 2013 ) and tests of short-term memory rather than working memory 
(Chacko et al., 2014a ; Roberts et al., 2016 ), and/or reflects misinterpretation of interaction 
effects that show control group decrements rather than treatment group improvements 
(Redick, 2015 ). Taken together, the evidence strongly indicates that “claims regarding the 
academic, behavioral, and cognitive benefits associated with extant cognitive training 
programs are unsupported in ADHD” ( Rapport et al., 2013 , p. 1237), and as such working 
memory training “cannot be recommended as an educational tool” ( Sala & Gobet, 2017 , p. 
682) and “should not be considered a viable treatment for children with ADHD” ( Chacko et 
al., 2014a , p. 247).
Taken together, the literature indicates that working memory shows strong covariation with 
ADHD’s core behavioral and functional impairments but that working memory training fails 
to improve these outcomes. The reason for this incongruence is not readily clear; however, 
two hypotheses show promise. First, working memory’s association with ADHD symptoms 
may be correlational, and better attributed to a common underlying mechanism ( Barkley, 
1997a ). In this case, the lack of transfer from working memory training to other skills/Kofler et al. Page 2

"abilities would be unsurprising because treating a secondary/peripheral symptom is unlikely 
to travel upstream to affect core, underlying deficits in the absence of transactional or 
reciprocal influences ( Rapport et al., 2001 ). Similarly, their developmental covariation may 
reflect an epiphenomenal association in that neurocognitive functioning predicts ADHD 
symptoms but is not causal (van Lieshout et al., 2013). These possibilities are undermined at 
least partially, however, based on experimental evidence that manipulating working memory 
demands can provocate and rarefy objectively-assessed ADHD inattentive ( Kofler et al., 
2010 ) and hyperactive behavior ( Rapport et al., 2009 ).
An alternate possibility is that extant training protocols target aspects of the working 
memory system that are either intact in ADHD or unrelated to the disorder’s phenotypic 
expression. The possibility of target misspecification was explored in a recent meta-analysis 
(Rapport et al., 2013 ), which concluded that current working memory trainings for ADHD 
focus almost exclusively on short-term memory (simple storage/rehearsal) rather than the 
dual-processing, continuous updating, and serial-reordering processes that specifically 
characterize the working memory construct ( Wager & Smith, 2003 ). Further, both Chacko et 
al. (2014a)  and Gibson et al. (2011)  differentiated short-term memory (maintenance) from 
working memory (processing + maintenance), and found that training effects are limited to 
short-term memory, with no significant improvement in working memory capacity for 
children with ADHD. A recent, population-based RCT of working memory training found 
the same: moderate gains on one of two measures of short-term memory, but no significant 
gains on any test of working memory ( Roberts et al., 2016 ).
Thus, a compelling possibility is that working memory training is ineffective because it does 
not train working memory. More specifically, current training tasks used in the ADHD 
literature may place insufficient demands on the specific processes that are most impaired in 
ADHD and drive working memory’s association with important behavioral and educational 
outcomes (for review, see Rapport et al., 2013 ). This hypothesis was the driving force behind 
the development of Central Executive Training (CET), a computerized training protocol 
created to provide broad training of the three primary processes that comprise the working 
memory construct (dual-processing, continuous updating, serial reordering; Wager & Smith, 
2003 ). Dual-processing  refers to diverse processes that involve operating on information 
while concurrently storing the same/different information (often measured by ‘complex 
span’ tasks; Conway et al., 2005 ), continuous updating  refers to the active addition and 
deletion of items from working memory ( Miyake & Friedman, 2012 ), and serial reordering 
refers to the mental manipulation of temporal/sequential order ( Rapport et al., 2009 ). We 
collectively refer to these three interrelated but separable functions of the mid-lateral 
prefrontal cortex and interconnected networks ( Nee et al., 2013 ; Wager & Smith, 2003 ) as 
the central executive ( Baddeley, 2007 ), or the working  components of working memory 
(Kasper et al., 2012 ; Rapport et al., 2013 ; Wells et al., 2018).
Central Executive Training (CET): Core Assumptions
A central tenet of computerized, cognitive training protocols is that meaningful and 
sustained improvement at the neural substrate level can be accomplished by extensive 
training involving repetition, practice, and feedback on activities supported by these neural Kofler et al. Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper13.pdf,3
"networks ( Rapport et al., 2013 ; Sala & Gobet, 2017 ; Shipstead et al., 2012 ). By extension, 
this improvement is expected to transfer to other skills and abilities that rely on the same 
neural networks (Simons et al., 2017).
Applied to CET, the following assumptions guided training task development:
1. Central executive deficits are an underlying neurocognitive mechanism that 
drive, to a significant extent, ADHD’s phenotypic expression for many children 
with ADHD ( Rapport et al., 2009 ).
2. Central executive abilities will improve with training for children with ADHD.
3. ADHD symptoms will decrease as central executive abilities improve, to the 
extent that this empirically-identified target is central to ADHD as hypothesized. 
We do not expect normalization of ADHD symptoms; 10-weeks of training 
cannot be realistically expected to overcome 3–4 year delays in CE-related 
cortical maturation found in pediatric ADHD samples ( Shaw et al., 2007 ). We 
speculate that continued training will produce incremental gains over time or 
slight alterations in developmental trajectories that may only be realized over 
time (Halperin & Healey, 2011).
4. Based on the clinical model of psychopathology ( Rapport et al., 2001 ) and the 
greater impact of proximal confounding influences (e.g., skill/knowledge gaps), 
CET’s effects on peer, family, academic, and organizational impairments in 
ADHD will be more modest. CET does not teach social or academic skills; 
rather, these skills are expected to become more amenable to targeted 
intervention following improvements in CE-related neural substrates that support 
planning and maintenance of goal-directed behavior ( Chacko et al., 2014b , 
2017 ).
5. More generally, the magnitude of improvement on any untrained outcome will be 
capped by (a) the magnitude of improvement in central executive working 
memory, and (b) the strength of central executive working memory’s association 
with the untrained outcome ( Rapport et al., 2013 ).
6. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder ( Nigg, 2005 ), with multiple pathways to its 
phenotypic expression ( Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010 ). Recent evidence suggests 
that approximately 80% ( Kasper et al., 2012 ) to 85% (Karalunas et al., in press) 
of children with ADHD have working memory deficits when assessed using 
tasks with a prominent executive component. At minimum, there will be a subset 
of children with ADHD who do not respond to CET because central executive 
deficits do not underlie their behavioral presentation. Optimal targeting will 
require neuropsychological assessment and an armamentarium of interventions 
to address each cognitive pathway to ADHD.
The current study describes the development of CET and provides a preliminary test of 
assumptions 1–3. All assumptions differ from psychosocial treatments that teach 
compensatory, regulatory, and problem-solving strategies ( Rapport et al., 2013 ), curriculum 
restructuring approaches intended to accommodate working memory deficits ( Elliott et al., Kofler et al. Page 4
J Consult Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper13.pdf,4
"2010 ), and behavioral approaches that target overt behaviors ( Evans et al., 2014 ). This latter 
distinction is consistent with recent hypotheses that behavioral treatment may work, in part, 
by inadvertently circumventing working memory (e.g., breaking down multi-step 
instructions, providing explicit reminders; Kofler et al., 2017 ). CET’s assumptions differ 
also from approaches that emphasize in vivo  cognitive training as a prerequisite for transfer 
of training gains (Halperin et al., 2012). As described below, CET also differs fundamentally 
from extant ADHD cognitive training protocols in its training targets, methods of adapting 
task parameters to hit those targets, and emphasis on requiring recall rather than recognition.
Current Study
The current study describes CET’s development and an initial test of CET relative to 
behavioral parent training (BPT). BPT was selected as an active comparator because it is a 
current gold standard psychosocial intervention for ADHD ( Evans et al., 2014 ). We 
hypothesized that CET would be comparable to BPT in terms of feasibility/acceptability for 
caregivers and children. We further hypothesized that CET would produce significant 
improvements on untrained working memory tests that would be superior to any 
improvements associated with BPT. To our knowledge, only two studies have reported 
effects of behavioral treatment on cognitive outcomes for children with ADHD, and neither 
found significant changes (Hannesdottir et al., 2014; Steeger et al., 2016 ). Finally, we 
predicted that CET and BPT would produce similar improvements in objectively-assessed 
ADHD symptoms.
Method
Preregistration and Open Data
Primary and secondary outcomes and detailed data analytic plans were preregistered at 
https://osf.io/9gcbd/ . There were no departures from the preregistered plan with one clearly 
marked exception. The de-identified raw data (.jasp) and detailed results output (including 
test statistics) are available for peer review as recommended ( Redick, 2015 ): https://osf.io/
9gcbd/ .
Study Timeline
Families recruited between June 2013 and December 2014 were offered behavioral parent 
training (BPT). Families recruited between June 2015 and December 2016 were offered 
central executive training (CET). Recruitment to BPT was closed when CET was ready for 
testing. Recruitment to this CET pilot study was closed when software for an active training 
comparator was completed. Both samples reflect consecutive referrals.
Participants
The modified CONSORT study flow diagram is shown in Figure 1 (modified to emphasize 
sequential design). As shown in Table 1, the treated sample comprised 54 children aged 8–
13 years ( M=10.43, SD=1.59; 21 girls) from the Southeastern U.S., consecutively referred to 
a university-based children’s learning clinic (CLC) through community resources. 
Psychoeducational evaluations were provided to caregivers. All parents/children gave Kofler et al. Page 5

"informed consent/assent; IRB approval was obtained. Child race/ethnicity was 76% 
Caucasian/Non-Hispanic, 9% Hispanic/English-speaking, 9% African American, and 6% 
multiracial.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
All children and caregivers completed an identical evaluation, regardless of group 
assignment, that included detailed, semi-structured clinical interviewing (K-SADS; 
Kaufman et al., 1997 ). The K-SADS (2013 Update) assesses developmental history as well 
as onset, course, and impairment of DSM-5 (APA, 2013) disorders in children and 
adolescents. Parent and teacher ADHD ratings were obtained from the Behavior Assessment 
System for Children (BASC-2; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004 ) and Child Symptom Inventory 
(CSI-IV; Gadow & Sprafkin, 2002 ).
Study eligibility required: (1) DSM-5 diagnosis of ADHD (any presentation) by the 
directing clinical psychologist based on K-SADS; and (2) Borderline/clinical elevations on 
at least one parent and one teacher ADHD rating scale, or previous psychoeducational 
evaluation documenting cross-informant symptoms (e.g., for children prescribed medication 
that reduces ADHD symptoms at school; ‘otherwise specified’ presentation was specified 
for n=2 children who met criteria based on only one informant). All children had current 
impairment based on K-SADS. Comorbidities reflect clinical consensus best estimates, and 
include oppositional defiant (37.0%), anxiety (16.7%), depressive (9.3%), and autism 
spectrum disorders (3.7%). The BPT and CET groups were equivalent proportionally in 
comorbidities overall ( χ2[1]=0.00, p=.99, ns, BF 01=3.23), or across diagnostic categories 
(χ2[4]=4.39, p=.68, ns, BF 01=142.4). BF 01 is an odds ratio indicating support for the null 
hypothesis that the groups are equivalent (H 0) relative to the alternative hypothesis that the 
groups differ (H 1) (see Bayesian Analyses  section below).
Learning disabilities were suspected in 26% of BPT and 19% of CET cases based on 
score(s) >1.5 SD below age-based norms on one or more KTEA-2/3 core subtests ( Kaufman 
& Kaufman, 2004 , 2014 ); these proportions did not differ significantly ( χ2[1]=0.43, p=.51, 
ns, BF 01=2.98). Fifteen children in the BPT group (55.6%) and 9 children in the CET group 
(33.3%) were currently prescribed psychostimulants. An additional 3 CET children received 
previous psychostimulant trials. The BPT/CET difference in current medication rates did not 
reach significance ( p=.10, ns, BF 01=1.19). The BPT and CET groups were equivalent with 
regard to medication changes during the study ( p=.63, ns, BF 01=8.82; Table 1).
Children were excluded for gross neurological, sensory, or motor impairment; seizure 
disorder, psychosis, or intellectual disability; or non-stimulant medications that could not be 
withheld for testing. No inclusion/exclusion based on working memory/executive 
functioning performance was set.
Procedures
Best practices for cognitive training studies were followed as detailed in Supplementary 
Table 1 ( Redick, 2015 ; Simons et al., 2017). Pre-treatment testing occurred during a larger 
battery of two, 3-hour sessions. Post-testing occurred during a single, 3-hour session. A 90-
minute mid-treatment testing session was conducted for children in the BPT group. As Kofler et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper13.pdf,6
"specified in the NIH R34 proposal (R34 MH102499), no mid-treatment sessions were 
completed for the first wave of CET testing. This design difference was considered 
acceptable because it favored the null (i.e., test-retest effects, if present, would favor the BPT 
group). Statistical tests therefore assess pre-post changes as preregistered.
All tests were counterbalanced within/across sessions to minimize order/fatigue effects. 
Children received brief breaks after each task, and preset longer breaks every 2–3 tasks to 
minimize fatigue.
Treatments
BPT and CET were both delivered according to manualized procedures in small group 
format (2–6 families) or individually as needed to accommodate families’ schedules. 
Schedule changes were accommodated to the extent possible (e.g., make-up sessions the 
same week). Identical procedures were used for both samples (e.g., 1-hour in-office 
sessions). Families were not required to withhold psychostimulants prior to child treatment 
visits. Psychostimulants were withheld for ≥24-hours prior to all child pre/post testing 
sessions.
Behavioral Parent Training (BPT)
Evidence-based BPT ( Evans et al., 2014 ) was provided using the manualized Barkley 
(1997b)  Defiant Children  protocol. BPT was delivered by behaviorally trained, PhD-level 
clinicians (MJK, DES, HSS). As reported below, parent-reported ADHD symptom 
reductions in this group were consistent with ( van der Oord et al., 2008 ) or larger than 
(Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ) expectations based on meta-analysis.
Central Executive Training (CET)
CET is a translational, evidence-informed, hybrid (in-office and at-home), and software-
based treatment protocol that includes gaming elements ( Prins et al., 2011 ) and an 
automated token economy to reinforce training goals and improve player engagement. The 
final 10-week protocol includes weekly in-office sessions with the child (1 hour) and a 
concurrent parent psychoeducational group, combined with parent-supervised, in-home 
training (goal: 15-min/day, 2–3 days/week).
Hitting the Target:  We developed nine training tasks (‘games’) to form a clinical protocol 
and maximize the likelihood that CET would adequately engage central executive (CE) 
working memory, and not just short-term memory (Table 2)1. That is, CET is less concerned 
with increasing the number of items children can hold in short-term memory (the memory 
components of working memory) and more focused on improving what children can do with 
those items (the working  components of working memory). This targeting was based on (a) 
neuroimaging meta-analyses demonstrating overlapping and non-overlapping mid-lateral 
prefrontal and interconnected regions associated with each of the three central executive 
processes ( Nee et al., 2013 ; Wager & Smith, 2003 ), (b) cross-sectional evidence of ADHD-

"related cortical underdevelopment in each implicated region (for reviews, see Kasper et al., 
2012 ; Rapport et al., 2013 ), and (c) longitudinal evidence of 3–4 year delays in cortical 
maturation of these regions in pediatric ADHD samples ( Shaw et al., 2007 ). CET 
emphasizes recall instead of recognition based on compelling evidence that recognition-
based tasks share minimal variance ( r=.20) with criterion working memory recall tasks 
(Redick & Lindsey, 2013 ).
As shown in Table 2, each CET game targets a unique combination of CE process (dual-
processing, continuous updating, serial reordering) and stimulus modality (phonological, 
visual, spatial). No additional executive functions were targeted based on meta-analytic 
evidence that ADHD cognitive training protocols are less effective when potency is 
decreased by targeting multiple executive functions (e.g., near transfer d=0.63 for short-term 
memory (STM) training vs. d=0.19 for STM + inhibition training; Rapport et al., 2013 ). 
Given the limited role of short-term memory deficits in ADHD symptoms/impairments (e.g., 
Kasper et al., 2012 ), we created games involving all three short-term memory modalities to 
facilitate generalization of CE-related improvements.
Adaptive Training:  CET was designed as a competence-oriented training in which the 
child’s basal level is established and they are trained up from there, thus ensuring that each 
child is constantly working within her/his zone of proximal development (“flow state” in the 
serious games literature) ( Canon-Bowers & Bowers, 2010 ). A critical distinction between 
CET and extant, capacity-based protocols ( Rapport et al., 2013 ) is that CET’s algorithms 
dynamically adjust multiple parameters to incrementally increase demands on central 
executive processes. These parameters are dependent on training target (Table 2), and 
include aspects such as target density, categories:stimuli ratio, target:nontarget stimuli ratio, 
visual discriminability, and search space size. For example, increasing the search space size 
produces greater visual saccades, which in turn increase central executive demands during 
spatial working memory tasks because these saccades interrupt spatial rehearsal ( Awh et al., 
2001 ; Postle et al., 2004 ).
CET’s adaptive algorithms were set to ensure incremental increases in central executive 
demands based on child performance. This process occurred during the current study and 
involved iterative changes and extensive testing with research assistants (alpha testing) and 
children with ADHD (beta testing). To ensure breadth of training, the software’s ‘Mission 
Mode’ automatically selects games that the child has not completed recently. CET’s 
automated token economy awards ‘tickets’ for successful recall during each game, for 
completing each game, and for completing the daily ‘Mission Mode.’ These tickets are 
exchanged for tangible prizes during the weekly in-office sessions.
Beta testing:  The CET sample was recruited in 3 waves to facilitate software refinements 
and testing of key design features. As specified in the NIH grant proposal (R34 MH102499), 
the first wave trained on one game per week, the second wave had immediate access to all 9 
training games, and the third wave ( n=9 per wave) tested the final protocol that implemented 
all CET features (e.g., tickets, ‘Mission Mode’ detailed above). To reduce child 
expectancies, children were told that they were ‘beta testers’ for our video game design 
team.Kofler et al. Page 8

"Focus groups:  Parents in the first two CET subgroups participated in focus groups. Key 
CET design changes based on these focus groups included overhauling the on-screen 
instructions, modifying the home screen to show child progress (daily games completed), 
and automation of the token economy via children earning on-screen ‘tickets’ that are 
exchanged for tangible, in-office rewards. Key logistical changes from these focus groups 
included improved communication with parents (e.g., access/login instructions, progress 
monitoring of days/games completed at home), modified expectations for at-home training 
duration (original goal of 30-minutes/day decreased to 15-minutes/day) and frequency 
(original daily training goal decreased to 2–3 days/week), and modified treatment duration 
(original 12-weeks decreased to 10-weeks). Finally, parent feedback resulted in the addition 
of a parent group that began mid-way through testing with subgroup 2.
Parent groups:  The parent psychoeducation group occurred in a separate room from the 
child in-office training session, led by PhD-level study therapists (MJK, KA). The parent 
component was added during CET wave 2 (described above) and made optional for parents 
based on parent focus group feedback. Parent groups were intended to promote treatment 
adherence and troubleshoot difficulties with the at-home training (e.g., demonstrating login 
procedures, brainstorming feasible days/times for the child to complete training). A further 
goal of the parent group was to establish the infrastructure anticipated for future trials that 
combine CET with extant evidence-based psychosocial treatments, because most of these 
programs involve working with the parent rather than child (e.g., parent training; Chacko et 
al., 2017 ). The psychoeducational component is manualized and provides general 
information about ADHD-relevant topics (e.g., common cormorbidities, evidence-based 
treatment options, IEP/504 Plans). Importantly, no active treatment components are included 
in the parent group.
Measures
Intellectual Functioning (IQ) and Socioeconomic Status (SES) at Pre-
Treatment— IQ was estimated using the WASI-II (BPT) or WISC-V (CET) Verbal 
Comprehension Index (Wechsler, 2011, 2014). The changeover was made due to the WISC-
V’s release during the course of the study and to provide caregivers with most up-to-date 
psychoeducational evaluation possible. Hollingshead (1975) SES was estimated based on 
caregiver(s)’ education and occupation.
Feasibility, Acceptability, and Usability Outcomes
Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Nguyen et al., 1983 ): The CSQ-8 is an 
extensively studied, 8-item generic measure of clients’ perceptions of the value of services 
received (e.g., “to what extent has our program met your needs?”). Parents completed the 
CSQ-8 at post-treatment. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction (range=1–4).
Barriers to Treatment Participation Scale (BTPS; Kazdin et al., 1997 ): The BTPS is a 
44-item measure of perceived treatment barriers completed by parents at post-treatment 
(e.g., “my job got in the way of coming to a session”); item scores are summed to provide a 
Total Barriers score (% possible barriers). Higher scores indicate more barriers.Kofler et al. Page 9
J Consult Clin Psychol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 December 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper13.pdf,9
"System Usability Scale (SUS; Canon-Bowers & Bowers, 2010 ): The SUS is a 10-item, 
item response theory-developed scale assessing ease of use  on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “I 
thought the game system was easy to use”). Children in the CET group completed the SUS 
at post-treatment. Higher scores indicate greater usability (range = 0–100).
CET Training Duration:  The CET software records training duration for each completed 
training game (time spent actively engaged); total minutes trained and total completed 
games are reported.
Subjective ADHD symptom changes:  As specified in the NIH R34 proposal and following 
best practices for cognitive training studies (Simons et al., 2017), unblinded parent reports of 
ADHD symptoms were interpreted as additional evidence of feasibility/acceptability rather 
than efficacy. Parent-reported Attention Problems and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity were 
assessed via T-scores on the BASC-2 (age and gender norms; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004 ) 
and raw symptom severity scores on the CSI-IV ( Gadow & Sprafkin, 2002 ). Higher scores 
indicate greater symptom quantity/severity.
Primary Outcomes (Working Memory; WM)— The well-validated Rapport et al. 
(2009)  phonological (PHWM) and visuospatial (VSWM) computerized WM tests correctly 
classify children with vs. without ADHD at similar rates as parent and teacher ADHD rating 
scales ( Tarle et al., 2017 ), and predict hyperactivity ( Rapport et al., 2009 ), inattention 
(Kofler et al., 2010 ), and impulsivity ( Raiker et al., 2012 ). Reliability and validity evidence 
includes internal consistency ( α=.82–.97), 1–3-week test-retest reliability (.76–.90; Sarver et 
al., 2015 ), and expected relations with criterion WM complex span ( r=.69) and updating 
tasks ( r=.61) (Wells et al., 2018).
Both tasks involve serial reordering of characters presented (numbers, black dot locations), 
and reordering of a target stimulus (letter, red dot location) into the final serial position 
recalled. The phonological task involved mentally reordering and verbally recalling a 
jumbled series of sequentially presented numbers and letters (e.g., 4H62 is correctly recalled 
as 246H). The visuospatial task involved mentally reordering a sequentially presented series 
of spatial locations based on what color dot appeared in each location (black dots in serial 
order, red dot last) and responding on a modified keyboard. Six trials per set size were 
administered in randomized/unpredictable order for each task (3–6 stimuli/trial; 1 stimuli/
second) as recommended ( Kofler et al., 2017a ). The 24 total trials per task were randomized, 
then grouped into 2 blocks of 12 trials each, with short breaks between each block 
(approximately 1 minute) ( Kofler et al., 2016 ). Five practice trials were administered before 
each task (80% correct required). Task duration was approximately 5 (VSWM) to 7 
(PHWM) minutes.
Dependent variables:  Stimuli correct per trial were computed at each set size as 
recommended ( Conway et al., 2005 ), and averaged to provide separate indicators for PHWM 
and VSWM. Higher scores reflect better working memory.Kofler et al. Page 10

"Secondary Outcomes (Objectively-Assessed ADHD Hyperactivity)
Objective measurement:  Micro Motionlogger actigraphs ( Ambulatory Monitoring, 2014 ) 
are acceleration-sensitive devices that sample movement intensity 16 times per second (16 
Hz), collapsed into 1-second epochs. The estimated reliability for actigraphs placed at the 
same site on the same person ranges from .90 to .99 ( Tryon et al., 1991 ). Actigraphs show 
expected levels of correspondence with parent- and teacher-reported hyperactivity ( r=.32–.
58), have superior predictive validity relative to rating scales for differentiating children with 
all subtypes/presentations of ADHD (including Predominantly Inattentive) from 
neurotypical children and from children with other clinical disorders at both the group and 
individual levels, and outperform other mechanical devices for differentiating ADHD from 
Non-ADHD groups (for meta-analytic review, see Kofler et al., 2016 ).
Children were told that the actigraphs were “special watches” that let them play the 
computer learning games. Observer XT ( Noldus, 2012 ) software was used to code start and 
stop times for each task, which were matched to the time stamps from the actigraphs. 
Actigraphs were placed on the child’s non-dominant wrist and both ankles.
Following Rapport et al. (2009) , a total hyperactivity score (THS)  was computed by 
summing activity level across the three actigraphs. Hyperactivity scores were computed 
separately for movement during each of the WM tests described above (proximal outcomes), 
as well as for movement during the control conditions that occurred as the first and last 
activities of each testing session (distal outcomes). During the control conditions, children 
used Microsoft Paint for five consecutive minutes at the beginning and end of all pre- and 
post-treatment sessions. Children sat in the same chair and interacted with the same 
computer used for the WM tasks.
Bayesian Analyses— Traditional null hypothesis significance tests ( p-values) were 
supplemented with Bayes Factors as recommended ( Redick, 2015 ). The benefits of Bayesian 
methods are well documented (e.g., Wagenmakers et al., 2016 ); for our purposes, Bayesian 
analyses were added because they allow stronger conclusions by estimating the magnitude 
of support for both the alternative and null hypotheses ( Rouder & Morey, 2012 ). Bayes 
factor mixed-model ANOV As, paired-samples t-tests, and independent sample t-tests 
(Rouder & Morey, 2012 ; Wagenmakers et al., 2016 ) with default prior scales were 
conducted using JASP 0.8.2 (JASP Team, 2017). Instead of a p-value, these analyses provide 
BF10, which is the Bayes Factor of the alternative hypothesis (H 1) against the null 
hypothesis (H 0). BF 10 is an odds ratio, where values above 3.0 are considered significant 
evidence supporting the alternative hypothesis (conceptual equivalent of p < .05). BF 10 
values above 10.0 are considered strong (>30 = very strong, >100 = decisive/extreme 
support; Wagenmakers et al., 2016 ).
Conversely, BF 01 is the Bayes Factor of the null hypothesis (H 0) against the alternative 
hypothesis (H 1). BF 01 is the inverse of BF 10 (i.e., BF 01 = 1/BF 10), and is reported when the 
evidence indicates a lack of an effect (i.e., favors the null hypothesis; Rouder & Morey, 
2012 ). BF 01 values are interpreted identically to BF 10 (>3.0 = moderate, > 10.0 = strong, > 
100 = decisive/extreme support for the null hypothesis that a predictor does not have an 
effect on an outcome; Rouder & Morey, 2012 ).Kofler et al. Page 11

"Between-group comparisons are supplemented with Cohen’s d effect sizes (converted from 
η2p to aid interpretability). Both p-values and Bayes Factors are reported for transparency. P-
values were preregistered as the primary indicator if discrepancies arose.
Data Analysis Overview
Data analyses were conducted using JASP 0.8.2 according to the preregistered plan. We 
initially compared pre-treatment characteristics of treated vs. assessed but untreated children 
to probe the representativeness of our treatment samples (CONSORT Figure 1). We then 
compared the treated BPT and CET samples on pre-treatment characteristics, study 
retention, and feasibility/acceptability outcomes. Finally, BPT and CET were compared for 
effects on our primary outcomes (WM) and secondary outcomes (objective ADHD symptom 
assessments). These analyses involved residual gain scores (i.e., between-group comparison 
of post-treatment scores, covaried for pre-treatment scores) and group x outcome x time 
mixed-model ANOV As. Two measures were used for each primary and secondary outcome 
to maximize power and strengthen interpretation ( Shipstead et al., 2012 ). Exploratory 
analyses were added to address the mechanism of change, and involved correlating overall 
changes in working memory with changes in objectively-assessed ADHD symptoms during 
the proximal and distal activities.
Results
Treated vs. Untreated Samples: Pre-Treatment Characteristics
As shown in CONSORT Figure 1, we evaluated 79 children for eligibility, of whom 54 
received treatment and 25 did not. There were no significant differences between the treated 
(N=54) and untreated samples ( N=25) on any of the pre-treatment variables listed in Table 1. 
The treated and untreated samples were equivalent in terms of gender, IQ, medication status, 
race/ethnicity, % comorbidity, all parent reported ADHD subscales, teacher-reported 
hyperactivity, WM test performance, and hyperactivity during the visuospatial and end of 
session baseline tasks (all p ≥ .10, all BF 01 ≥ 3.06). The treated and untreated samples did 
not differ significantly on age, SES, ADHD subtype, or hyperactivity during the 
phonological and beginning of session baseline tasks (all p ≥ .15, all BF 01 ≥ 1.41). Untreated 
children were not followed beyond the pre-treatment evaluation.
BPT vs. CET Samples: Pre-Treatment Characteristics
As shown in Table 1, the BPT and CET treated samples did not differ on any demographic 
variables. Based on these analyses, no demographic covariates were included when 
assessing differential pre-post change as a function of BPT vs. CET.
Study Retention
Study retention was high for both BPT and CET. Notably, 100% of children in both BPT and 
CET completed the post-treatment testing, regardless of completer/non-completer status. Of 
the non-completers, 4 families discontinued BPT after 4–5 sessions but agreed to return for 
child testing (none completed parent questionnaires), and 3 families discontinued CET after 
2–6 sessions but returned for child testing (2 did not complete parent questionnaires). All 
other families completed at least 8 BPT or CET sessions and all scheduled assessments.Kofler et al. Page 12

"Outlier and Missing Data Handling
Outliers ≥3.0 SD were winsorized relative to the within-group distribution (BPT: 0.62% of 
data points, CET: 0.76% of data points). Missing data rates were low and did not differ 
between BPT ( M=2.0%, SD = 6.0) and CET ( M=1.0%, SD = 3.0)( p=.38, BF 01=2.63). 
Little’s MCAR test indicated that these data were missing completely at random ( χ2 
[167]=144.49, p = .90). Missing data were therefore imputed using the preregistered plan 
(expectation-maximization based on all available data).
Feasibility/acceptability/usability
CSQ-8, BTPS, SUS, and CET engagement— BPT and CET were highly feasible and 
acceptable to parents (Table 3a). BPT and CET did not differ in parent-reported treatment 
satisfaction ( p=.18, BF 01=1.69) and were equivalent in terms of parent-reported treatment 
barriers ( p=.59, BF 01=3.24). Children in the CET sample rated the software as easy to use 
on the SUS (Table 3a). Mean number of completed training games was 53.00 per child 
(SD=40.33).
BASC-2— Controlling for pre-treatment scores, CET and BPT did not differ at post-
treatment for Attention Problems ( d = 0.51, η2p=.06; p=.07, BF 10=1.11) or Hyperactivity/
Impulsivity ( d=0.20, η2p=.01; p=.45, BF 01=2.93). The group (BPT, CET) x symptom 
domain (Attention Problems, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity) x time (Pre, Post) mixed-model 
ANOV A was significant for the main effect of time ( p<.001, BF 10=9.14 × 108), the time x 
symptom interaction ( p=.004, BF 10=7.26), and the time x group x symptom interaction ( p=.
03, BF 01=2.41). The groups showed statistically equivalent change over time (group x time 
interaction: d=0.06, η2p=.001; p=.80, BF 01=5.38) (Supplementary Fig. 1, top).
Paired-sample t-tests indicated that the CET group showed large reductions in Attention 
Problems ( d=0.97, p<.001, BF 10=811.14) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( d=0.96, p<.001, 
BF10=689.11). Likewise, the BPT group showed medium reductions in Attention Problems 
(d=0.61, p=.004, BF 10=10.40) and large reductions in Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( d=1.47, 
p<.001, BF 10=3.43 × 105).
CSI-IV— Controlling for pre-treatment scores, CET and BPT were equivalent at post-
treatment for Inattention ( d=0.00, η2p=.000; p=.98, BF 01=3.68) and Hyperactivity/
Impulsivity ( d=0.20, η2p=.01; p=.45, BF 01=3.62). The group (BPT, CET) x symptom 
domain (Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity) x time (Pre, Post) mixed-model ANOV A 
was significant for time ( p<.001, BF 10=3.26 × 1026) and symptom domain ( p<.001, 
BF10=852.32). The groups showed equivalent change over time (group x time interaction: 
d=0.17, η2p=.007; p=.56, BF 01=4.26) (Supplementary Figure 1, bottom).
Paired-sample t-tests indicated that the CET group showed large reductions in Inattention 
(d=1.60, p<.001, BF 10=1.54 × 106) and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity ( d=1.35, p<.001,

"Primary Outcomes (Working Memory)
Controlling for pre-treatment scores, CET was superior to BPT at post-treatment for 
improving VSWM ( d=0.91, η2p=.17; p<.001, BF 10=13.38) and PHWM ( d=0.77, η2p=.13; 
p<.001, BF 10=5.57) (Table 3b). The group (BPT, CET) x task (VSWM, PHWM) x time 
(Pre, Post) mixed-model ANOV A was significant for time ( p<.001, BF 10=276.89), task ( p<.
001, BF 10=8.30 × 1016), and the group x time interaction ( d=1.06, η2p=.22; p<.001, 
BF10=53.40) (Figure 2).
Paired-sample t-tests indicated that the CET group showed large magnitude improvements in 
VSWM ( d=1.05, p<.001, BF10=2.13 × 103) and PHWM ( d=0.97, p<.001, BF 10=812.26). In 
contrast, the BPT group did not show significant pre/post change for VSWM ( d=0.29, p=.14, 
BF01=1.75) or PHWM ( d= 0.22, p=.26, BF 01=2.70).
Secondary Outcomes (Objective Hyperactivity Assessment)
Proximal outcomes: actigraphs during working memory testing— Controlling for 
pre-treatment scores, CET was superior to BPT for reducing post-treatment hyperactivity 
during VSWM testing ( d=0.74, η2p=.12; p=.01, BF 10=3.90) but not during PHWM testing 
(d=0.20, η2p=.01; p=.50, BF 01=2.98). Given this discrepancy, we departed from the 
preregistered plan to assess treatment-related change over time separately by task.2 The 
group (BPT, CET) x time (Pre, Post) mixed-model ANOV A for hyperactivity during VSWM 
testing was significant for time ( p=.007, η2p=.13, BF 10=3.88) and the group x time 
interaction ( d=0.74, η2p=.12; p=.01, BF 10=4.87). Paired-sample t-tests indicated that the 
CET group showed large reductions in hyperactivity ( d=0.78, p<.001, BF 10=75.09), whereas 
the BPT group was equivalent at pre and post treatment ( d= −0.02, p=.94, BF 01=4.89) for 
hyperactivity during VSWM testing (Supplementary Figure 2, bottom left).
In contrast, hyperactivity during PHWM testing showed nonsignificant time ( d=0.55, η2p=.
07; p=.06, BF 10=1.05) and group x time interaction effects ( d=0.06, η2p=.001; p=.87, 
BF01=2.96). Paired-sample t-tests indicated that CET group reductions in hyperactivity 
failed to reach significance ( d=0.36, p=.07, BF 01=1.04); the BPT group was equivalent at 
pre and post treatment ( d=0.16, p=.41, BF 01=4.89) (Supplementary Figure 2, bottom right).
Distal outcomes: actigraphs during baseline painting— Controlling for pre-
treatment scores, CET was superior to BPT for reducing hyperactivity during the beginning 
of session ( d=0.91, η2p=.17; p=.002, BF 10=19.06) and end of session control activities 
(d=0.91, η2p=.17; p=.003, BF 10=15.98). The group (BPT, CET) x condition (session 
beginning, end) x time (Pre, Post) mixed-model ANOV A was significant for condition ( p<.
001, η2p=.27, BF 10=137.67) and the group x time interaction ( d=0.74, η2p=.12; p=.04, 
BF10=13.66) (Supplementary Figure 3).

"end of each session ( d=0.60, p=.004, BF 10=9.52); the BPT group’s hyperactivity did not 
change significantly during the beginning ( d=−0.23, p=.25, BF 01=2.60) or end of session 
activities ( d=0.01, p=.99, BF 01=4.91).
Exploratory Analyses: Mechanisms of Change
Exploratory analyses were conducted to test the hypothesis that WM improvements would 
predict objectively-assessed ADHD symptom reductions (Figure S4). Change scores were 
computed for each primary and secondary outcome, and averaged separately to estimate 
overall changes in WM, objective hyperactivity (proximal assessment), and objective 
hyperactivity (distal assessment). Results indicated that WM improvements were 
significantly associated with reductions in objectively-measured hyperactivity during both 
the proximal ( r= −.31, p=.01, BF 10= 4.34) and distal ( r= −.37, p=.003, BF 10=14.43) 
assessments. Combined with the primary analyses above, these findings provide preliminary 
evidence that CET engages its intended mechanism, and that improvements in this 
mechanism are associated, to a significant extent, with reductions in objectively-measured 
ADHD symptoms as hypothesized.
Discussion
The current study described the development, empirical basis, and initial testing of central 
executive training (CET) relative to behavioral parent training (BPT), a current gold-
standard non-medication treatment for ADHD. Confidence in the findings is supported by 
methodological strengths including detailed preregistration of the study’s outcomes and 
analytic plan, open data policy, adherence to best practice guidelines for cognitive training 
studies as outlined in Supplementary Table 1 ( Redick, 2015 ; Simons et al., 2017), and use of 
outcome measures with strong construct and predictive validity evidence. The developed 
CET protocol was rated as highly usable by children with ADHD, and was equivalent to 
BPT on all parent-reported feasibility/acceptability outcomes, including high satisfaction, 
low perceived treatment barriers, and large perceived ADHD symptom reductions.
As hypothesized, CET was superior to BPT for improving working memory during both 
criterion tests ( d=1.06), suggesting that CET was successful in engaging its intended training 
target. More importantly, CET but not BPT produced reductions in objectively-assessed 
hyperactivity during three of the four conditions, including both of the most distal far-
transfer outcomes ( d=0.74). Further, improvements in working memory correlated with 
reductions in objectively-assessed ADHD symptoms, and our objective estimates of CET’s 
effect on hyperactivity during the most distal outcomes were highly consistent with 
expectations based on juxtaposing CET’s effects on improving working memory ( d=1.06) 
with prior evidence regarding the relation between working memory and actigraph-measured 
hyperactivity ( Rapport et al., 2009 ). To our knowledge, this is the first cognitive training 
study to report objective, clinically significant reductions in ADHD symptoms that exceed 
those associated with gold-standard behavioral treatment ( Rapport et al., 2013 ). These 
findings provide strong support for moving ahead with a randomized CET efficacy trial and, 
if replicated, would support recent hypotheses that next-generation ADHD cognitive training Kofler et al. Page 15

"protocols may overcome current limitations via improved targeting of etiologically-relevant 
constructs and neurocognitive systems ( Chacko et al., 2014b ; Rapport et al., 2013 ).
With regard to the treatment feasibility/acceptability indicators, reductions in parent-
reported ADHD symptoms ( d=0.61–1.79) in the current study were somewhat larger than 
expectations based on recent meta-analyses for both BPT ( d=0.40; Sonuga-Barke et al., 
2013 ) and working memory training ( d=0.63; Rapport et al., 2013 ). Several explanations 
merit consideration, including delivery of BPT by behaviorally trained PhDs (expertise 
and/or allegiance effects), and parents’ active participation that precluded blinding to 
treatment. Meta-analytic evidence suggests that effect sizes for unblinded ADHD symptom 
ratings are inflated similarly for working memory training (Δ d=0.36–0.40) and behavioral 
intervention studies (Δ d=0.38) ( Rapport et al., 2013 ; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ). Thus, while 
these findings would suggest that our use, in part, of unblinded parent ratings was unlikely to 
differentially affect the treatments, they do suggest that conclusions regarding effect 
magnitude should be tempered. Taken together, these findings support our a priori decision 
to treat unblinded parent ratings as feasibility/acceptability data rather than evidence of 
treatment efficacy.
Interestingly, BPT failed to produce improvements in objectively-assessed ADHD symptoms 
during any of the four proximal or distal activities. This finding is consistent with meta-
analytic evidence that BPT improves functional impairments but not ADHD symptoms 
based on blinded ratings ( Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ), but may be unsurprising given the 
highly situation-specific nature of behavioral treatment effects ( Chronis et al., 2004 ). Meta-
analytic estimates of blinded ADHD ratings came primarily from school (teacher reports; 
Sonuga-Barke et al., 2013 ), and the current study assessed hyperactivity in a clinic setting, 
both of which are removed from the home setting where parents implement the behavioral 
techniques. In other words, the current findings should not be interpreted as evidence against 
BPT efficacy because by design parents were not present to implement contingencies during 
testing in the clinic. Further, this initial study did not assess for several key benefits of BPT 
(e.g., parent-child relational benefits, parenting confidence; Evans et al., 2014 ).
Behavioral parent training did not produce improvements in working memory for children 
with ADHD. This finding was highly consistent with previous evidence (Hannesdottir et al., 
2014; Steeger et al., 2016 ), and may suggest a potential mechanism to explain the rapid loss 
of treatment gains when BPT is discontinued ( Chronis et al., 2004 ). Although using 
nonsignificant findings to explain other nonsignificant findings is tenuous when based on 
frequentist statistics, the Bayesian models allowed stronger conclusions because they 
supported the null rather than just failing to reject it. The clinical model of psychopathology 
posits that treating a disorder’s peripheral symptoms is unlikely to affect upstream, core 
deficits in the absence of transactional or reciprocal influences ( Rapport et al., 2001 ). To the 
extent that inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity reflect the phenotypic expression of 
underlying working memory deficits for many children with ADHD as hypothesized 
(Rapport et al., 2013 ), the low maintenance of BPT gains may be due to a lack of change in 
the underdeveloped neurobiological substrate that produces these symptoms ( Kofler et al., 
2016 ). That is, this model posits that peripheral behavioral symptoms may be improved by 
targeting them directly (e.g., behavioral interventions), changing the environment to Kofler et al. Page 16

"circumvent the underlying impairments (e.g., accommodations), temporarily actuating the 
underdeveloped substrate (e.g., psychostimulant medication), and/or affecting developmental 
growth in that substrate (the hypothesized mechanism for cognitive training; Simons et al., 
2017). Only the latter is expected to produce lasting improvements beyond the active 
treatment phase. This explanation is consistent with the current finding that both groups 
demonstrated ADHD symptom reductions by unblinded parent report, but only the CET 
group improved on objective tests of working memory and hyperactivity; studies that 
include neuroimaging and long-term follow-up are needed to test for substrate-level changes 
and maintenance of gains beyond the active treatment phase.
Focus Group and Beta Testing Lessons: CET Feasibility vs. Ideal Dosing
There were several instances where our parent focus groups and child beta testing resulted in 
changes that improved treatment acceptability at the expense of reduced CET dosing (e.g., 
reduced at-home training goals). A critical lesson from this pilot study was the importance 
of the in-office sessions to ensure at least minimal exposure to the treatment. Among the 
final CET group, for example, 1/3 of the children completed 39–43 training games, which 
corresponds to the approximately 4 games per week completed during the in-office sessions. 
In contrast, the top 1/3 more regularly completed the at-home goals and completed 127–160 
training games during the same time period. Most caregivers described school-assigned 
homework as the biggest obstacle to at-home CET training; opinions were split 
approximately evenly regarding priority of CET vs. homework, with differences focused 
primarily on weighing immediate vs. delayed consequences. Examining dose response will 
be critical in the planned RCT for refining CET. Combining CET with behavioral parent 
training is likely to increase at-home training, but for this initial study we felt it important to 
exclude active treatment components from the parent group to prevent masking of effects 
and maximize certainty regarding effect specificity.
Limitations
As an initial development and feasibility study, there were ongoing changes to the CET 
software – including substantive changes such as automating the training-specific token 
economy – that likely produced somewhat different treatment experiences across children. In 
addition, the sequential design controls for most but not all threats to validity addressed by 
randomization (e.g., potential differential history effects between 2013–2015 vs. 2015–
2017), and inherent differences between behavioral parent training and central executive 
training introduce potential confounds that preclude strong efficacy conclusions from this 
initial trial (e.g., primary treatment target: parent vs. child; required parent-child interaction 
duration). In the context of significant hyperactivity reductions during the visuospatial and 
both distal tasks, it is unclear whether the equivocal finding during the phonological task 
suggests that CET’s effects on hyperactivity will be more pronounced in specific settings, as 
opposed to an artifact of lower power to detect small effects in our pilot study (e.g., the CET 
effect size of d=0.36 for hyperactivity reductions during the phonological test failed to reach 
significance at p=.07, with BF 01=1.01 indicating that the data are equally likely under the 
alternative and null hypotheses). Finally, as noted previously, we contend that it is 
unreasonable to expect a time-limited treatment to overcome the 3–4 year delays in 
prefrontal cortical maturation associated with pediatric ADHD ( Shaw et al., 2007 ), and as Kofler et al. Page 17

"such our far-transfer outcomes focused on continuous measures rather than diagnostic 
remission.
Clinical and Research Implications
Taken together, the results provide strong support for continued evaluation of central 
executive training (CET) for ADHD. Children with ADHD rated CET as highly usable, and 
CET was equivalent to BPT in terms of parent perceptions of high feasibility, acceptability, 
and efficacy. CET was superior to behavioral parent training for improving working memory 
based on all tests and for reducing objectively-measured hyperactivity during three of four 
activities – including both of the most distal far-transfer outcomes. If replicated, these 
findings would provide strong support for adding CET to our armamentarium of evidence-
based treatments for ADHD. Future work is needed to assess long-term maintenance of 
treatment gains, effects on ADHD-related functional impairments, and objective ADHD 
symptom reductions outside the clinic.

Background: Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
neurodevelopmental disorder in children, often accompanied by wo rking
memory deﬁcits. Recently, exercise interventions have gained attention as a
potentialstrategytoimprovecognitivefunctioninchildrenwi thADHD.However,
theeﬀectsofdiﬀerenttypesofexerciseonworkingmemoryremain unclear.This
study aimed to assess the eﬀects of various exercise intervent ions on working
memory in children with ADHD using a network meta-analysis.
Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane,
Embase, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies. After screening
accordingtotheinclusionandexclusioncriteria,atotalof/one.tnum/seven.tnumelig iblestudieswere
identiﬁed for analysis. A network meta-analysis was performed to integrate data
and evaluate the eﬀects of cognitive-aerobic exercise, ball gam es, mind-body
exercises, interactive games, and general aerobic exercise on working memory
in children with ADHD.
Results: The results indicated signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the eﬀectivenes s of
various types of exercise interventions on working memory in ch ildren with
ADHD. Cognitive-aerobic exercise showed the most signiﬁcant e ﬀect (SMD =
/zero.tnum./seven.tnum/two.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI: /zero.tnum./four.tnum/four.tnum–/one.tnum./zero.tnum/zero.tnum), followed by ball games (SMD =/zero.tnum./six.tnum/one.tnum, /nine.tnum/five.tnum% CI: −/zero.tnum./one.tnum/two.tnum–
/one.tnum./three.tnum/five.tnum). Mind-body exercises and interactive games had moderate eﬀects (SMD
=/zero.tnum./five.tnum/zero.tnum and /zero.tnum./three.tnum/seven.tnum, respectively), while general aerobic exercise sh owed relatively
smalleﬀects(SMD =/zero.tnum./four.tnum/zero.tnum,/nine.tnum/five.tnum%CI:/zero.tnum./one.tnum/nine.tnum–/zero.tnum./six.tnum/zero.tnum).SUCRAanalysisfurtherconﬁrmed
the highest preference for cognitive-aerobic exercise in impr oving working
memory.Meta-regressionanalysisshowedthatintervention frequencyandtotal

Conclusion: Cognitive-aerobic exercise had the most signiﬁcant eﬀect
on improving working memory in children with ADHD. Higher inter vention
frequency and longer intervention duration may enhance its eﬀe cts. Future
research should explore the impact of these factors and consider in creasing
sample sizes to validate the role of these moderators.

Attention Deﬁcit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a
neurodevelopmental disorder that has seen a rising prevalence
in recent years. The prevalence in children and adolescents is
approximately 5%–7%, with the diagnosis rate signiﬁcantly higher
in boys than in girls ( Mohammadi et al., 2021 ). According to data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by
2020, approximately 9.4% of children aged 3 to 17 years were
diagnosed with ADHD, which equates to nearly one in every 10
children being aﬀected ( Harris, 2024 ). Individuals with ADHD
commonly exhibit diﬃculty maintaining attention, are easily
distracted by external stimuli, show a lack of attention to detail,
and struggle to organize and complete tasks, particularly those
requiringsustainedfocus( Bush,2010 ).Additionally,hyperactivity
is often observed, such as an inability to sit still, frequent
movement, climbing, or running, and engaging in hyperactive
behaviors in inappropriate situations ( de la Peña et al., 2020 ).
ADHD patients tend to be impulsive, characterized by a lack of
self-control, poor planning, frequent interruptions of others, and
expressing opinions at inappropriate times ( Ayano et al., 2023 ).
In adults, symptoms may manifest as inner restlessness, diﬃculty
remaining calm, and emotional dysregulation ( Soler-Gutiérrez
etal.,2023 ).
Working memory refers to the ability to hold and manipulate
information over a short period and is a crucial component of
executive function, supporting the completion of daily tasks,
learning, and social interactions ( Baddeley, 2012 ). In individuals
with ADHD, impaired working memory leads to frequent
distractions and diﬃculty maintaining attention during tasks
(Kasper et al., 2012 ). This impairment manifests in several
ways: interruptions during multi-step tasks, forgetfulness of
important information, and challenges in emotional regulation
and impulse control ( Koﬂer et al., 2018 ;Ramos et al., 2020 ).
Two primary theoretical models explain the relationship between
ADHD and working memory. Barkley’s response inhibition
model suggests that deﬁcient response inhibition is the primary
impairment, leading to executive function deﬁcits including
working memory problems, which result in hyperactivity,
impulsivity, and inattention symptoms ( Barkley, 1997 ). The
alternative working memory model, drawing from Baddeley and
Hitch’s multi-component theory, positions working memory
deﬁcits as a core feature of ADHD ( Rapport et al., 2001 ).
This model, based on Baddeley and Hitch’s multi-component
working memory theory, includes four elements: the central
executive system, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad,
and the episodic buﬀer, which work together to coordinate the
storage and processing of information ( RepovŠ and Baddeley,
2006;Baddeley, 1996 ,1992). Deﬁcits in working memory pose
signiﬁcant challenges for ADHD patients in academic, social,
and emotional management. Improving working memory in
ADHD patients is considered key to enhancing their overall
cognitive function ( Rogers et al., 2011 ). Given these signiﬁcant
impacts of working memory deﬁcits on ADHD symptoms,
researchers have investigated various interventions to address
these challenges, with physical exercise emerging as a particularly
promisingapproach.Exercise refers to a subset of physical activity that is
planned, structured, repetitive, and purposive, with the objective
of improving or maintaining physical ﬁtness and overall health.
Unlike general physical activity, such as walking or casual playing,
exercise involves deliberate eﬀort to achieve speciﬁc ﬁtness goals
(Bouchard et al., 2012 ). This deﬁnition encompasses a wide
range of activities, including aerobic exercises, strength training,
ﬂexibility exercises, and motor skill-based training. In the context
of this study, we focus on aerobic exercises, which are deﬁned
as sustained physical activities that increase heart rate and
improve cardiovascular ﬁtness ( Kargarfard and Afrasyabi, 2015 ;
Mehren et al., 2019 ). These exercises can further be classiﬁed into
two main categories: traditional aerobic exercise and cognitively
enriched aerobic exercise. Traditional aerobic exercise involves
repetitive and rhythmic movements, such as running, swimming,
or cycling, aimed solely at improving physical endurance and
ﬁtness. Cognitively enriched aerobic exercise, on the other hand,
combines physical activity with simultaneous cognitive tasks,
such as decision-making, problem-solving, or memory challenges
(Karssemeijer et al., 2017 ;Shimada et al., 2018 ). Examples
include dual-task exercises, strategy-based games, and exergaming
(Lauenroth et al., 2016 ). By distinguishing between these two
types of aerobic exercise, this study aims to investigate their
diﬀerential impacts on working memory in children with ADHD,
emphasizing the potential added beneﬁts of cognitive engagement
duringphysicalactivity.
Exercise interventions have been shown in numerous studies
to have a positive impact on working memory ( Chaire et al., 2020 ;
Zhidong et al., 2021 ). Physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise
and moderate-intensity physical activity, is believed to promote
brainplasticity,enhanceneurotransmissionrelatedtomemoryand
learning (such as the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine),
and improve cerebral blood ﬂow and oxygen supply, thereby
facilitatingtheenhancementofworkingmemory( Pickersgilletal.,
2022;Johansson et al., 2022 ). Studies have found that regular
physicalactivity,particularlyexerciseformsthatinvolveattentional
demands,suchascognitive-motorskillexercises,notonlyimprove
workingmemorycapacitybutalsoenhanceinformationprocessing
speedandcognitiveﬂexibility( Houetal.,2024 ).Researchindicates
that aerobic exercises such as running, swimming, and cycling
can signiﬁcantly alleviate symptoms of hyperactivity, impulsivity,
and inattention in children with ADHD ( Feng et al., 2024 ;Sun
et al., 2022 ). Exercise not only helps release neurotransmitters
like dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain but also regulates
moodandimprovesbehavioralcontrol( Bastiolietal.,2022 ).These
eﬀectssigniﬁcantlycontributetoenhancingacademicperformance
and social skills in children with ADHD, while the feasibility and
enjoyment of physical activities make them more easily integrated
intotheirdailyroutines.
Although existing studies have conﬁrmed the positive impact
of exercise interventions on working memory in children with
ADHD, diﬀerences in intervention eﬀects may exist across
various types of exercise, such as aerobic exercise, cognitive
exercise, and skill-based exercises. However, most current studies
have focused on the eﬀects of individual exercise forms, and
comparativeresearchonmultipletypesofexerciseinterventionsis
relatively scarce. This limitation makes it diﬃcult for researchers

to comprehensively understand which exercise modality has
the most beneﬁcial eﬀect on improving working memory in
children with ADHD. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a

Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a comprehensive approach
that integrates the eﬀects of diﬀerent exercise interventions,
providing a more comprehensive reference for intervention
strategies.Basedonpreviousliteratureandtheoreticalframeworks,
we proposed the following hypotheses: Diﬀerent types of exercise
interventions would show varying degrees of eﬀectiveness in
improving working memory, with structured exercise programs
showing greater beneﬁts than general physical activity. Exercise
interventions that involve higher levels of cognitive engagement
and motor skill development would lead to greater improvements
in working memory performance compared to simple aerobic
exercises, due to their enhanced eﬀects on neural plasticity and
neurotransmitterregulation.

/two.tnum./three.tnum Inclusion and exclusion criteria
/two.tnum./three.tnum./one.tnum Inclusion criteria
Theinclusioncriteriaforthisstudywereasfollows:participants
were children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years diagnosed with
ADHD based on internationally recognized diagnostic criteria,
such as DSM-5 or ICD-10, ensuring consistency and accuracy in
ADHD diagnosis. The interventions included structured exerciseprograms, such as aerobic exercise (e.g., running, swimming),
strength training (e.g., resistance training), cognitive exercise,
and balance or coordination exercises, with clearly reported
duration, frequency, and intensity to ensure standardization
and reproducibility. The studies must include a control group,
such as no-intervention groups, routine care, or non-exercise
intervention groups (e.g., behavioral therapy), or comparisons
betweendiﬀerentexerciseinterventionswithsuﬃcientdistinction.
The primary outcome was required to focus on changes in
working memory, measured using standardized and validated
tools, with a clear distinction from other cognitive function
indicators when multiple outcomes were reported. Eligible study
designsincludedrandomizedcontrolledtrials(RCTs).Studieswere
excluded if they involved participants with severe neurological,
psychiatric, or physical disorders unrelated to ADHD, focused
solely on pharmacological or psychological therapies without an
exercise component, lacked adequate control groups, did not
report working memory-speciﬁc outcomes, or were published
in languages other than English or provided insuﬃcient data
foranalysis.
/two.tnum./three.tnum./two.tnum Exclusion criteria
Research subjects meeting any of the following criteria will
be excluded: (1) presence of severe mental or neurological
disorders that may aﬀect cognitive function; (2) ADHD diagnosis
based solely on teacher or parent reports without clinical
evaluation; (3) interventions where the independent eﬀects of
exercise cannot be isolated from other treatment components;
(4) studies where control groups received mixed interventions
for ethical or other considerations; (5) interventions lacking clear
documentationofexerciseinstructorqualiﬁcationsorprofessional
credentials; (6) studies without reported participant compliance
or completion rates; (7) research with signiﬁcant methodological
bias or inappropriate application of measurement instruments;
and (8) case studies, retrospective analyses, or review articles.
Additionally, studies showing signiﬁcant baseline diﬀerences
betweenexperimentalandcontrolgroupswithoutproperstatistical
adjustmentwillbeexcluded.
/two.tnum./four.tnum Literature screening and data extraction
During the literature screening and data extraction phase, the
retrieved studies will ﬁrst be imported into the EndNote reference
management software for duplicate removal. Subsequently, two
rounds of literature screening will be conducted according to
the pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the ﬁrst
round, screening will be based on titles and abstracts, and will be
performed by two independent reviewers to exclude studies that
clearly do not meet the criteria. The second round will involve
a full-text review of the studies that passed the initial screening
to ultimately determine which studies meet the inclusion criteria.
In cases of disagreement between the two reviewers during the
screening process, the issue will be resolved through discussion or
arbitrationbyathirdreviewer.

For data extraction, a pre-designed data extraction form
will be used to collect relevant information, including but
not limited to: basic study information (such as authors,

(such as age, gender, and ADHD diagnostic criteria), detailed
descriptions of the intervention (such as type of exercise,

by two reviewers, with cross-checking to ensure accuracy
and consistency. If any data is missing or unclear, attempts
will be made to contact the authors of the original studies
forclariﬁcation.
/two.tnum./five.tnum Quality assessment of the literature
To systematically assess the methodological quality of the
included studies, this research will use the Physiotherapy
Evidence Database (PEDro) scale to evaluate the quality of each
randomized controlled trial (RCT). The PEDro scale consists
of 11 criteria designed to identify potential biases in study
design, covering aspects such as random allocation, baseline
similarity, blinding, and outcome measurement. Studies with
a score below 4 will be considered to have a high risk of
methodological bias and will be excluded from the analysis;
studies with a score above 4 will be classiﬁed according to
score levels to ensure that only high-quality studies are included,
thereby improving the reliability of the results. For non-
randomizedcontrolledtrials(non-RCTs),thisresearchwillusethe
Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS)
scale to evaluate methodological quality. The MINORS scale
addresses the speciﬁc requirements for non-randomized studies,
including reporting baseline characteristics, describing sample
selection, and assessing primary outcomes. Similar to the PEDro
scale, the MINORS scale ensures a comprehensive evaluation
of methodological rigor and potential biases. The use of these
two scales ensures that the analysis is based on high-quality
evidence, minimizing the impact of methodological biases on the
studyconclusions.
/two.tnum./six.tnum Risk of bias assessment
The risk of bias assessment was conducted using tools
recommended by Cochrane. For randomized controlled trials
(RCTs), the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool was employed to
evaluate ﬁve domains: randomization process, intervention
implementation, missing data, outcome measurement, and
outcome reporting. Studies were rated as “low risk” if all domains
were assessed as low risk, “some concerns” if at least one domain
indicated concerns but none were high risk, and “high risk” if at
least one domain was high risk or four or more domains indicated
concerns. For non-randomized studies, the Risk Of Bias In
Non-randomizedStudies–ofInterventions,Version2(ROBINS-I
V2) tool was utilized to assess seven domains: confounding,
participant selection, intervention classiﬁcation, interventionimplementation, missing data, outcome measurement, and
outcome reporting. The risk of bias was categorized as “low,”
“moderate,”or“serious.”Theintegrationofresultsfrombothtools
enabled a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence quality in
thisstudy.
/two.tnum./seven.tnum Data analysis
In this study, the network meta-analysis will be conducted
using R software (version 4.3.2) with the “gemtc” package,
combined with the JAGS program, through the Bayesian Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm under a random-
eﬀects model for data synthesis. To ensure the accuracy of the
analysis, four Markov chains will be used for model construction,
with 20,000 iterations, the ﬁrst 5,000 of which will be used
for preliminary annealing to promote model convergence. The
eﬀectiveness of model convergence will be assessed using the
Potential Scale Reduction Factor (PSRF), with a PSRF value close
to 1 indicating satisfactory convergence. In the calculation of
eﬀect sizes, standardized mean diﬀerences (SMDs) and their 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CIs) will be used to accommodate variations
in measurement tools across the included studies. According to
Cohen’s classiﬁcation, an SMD ≥|0.8| is considered a large eﬀect,
≥|0.5| but <|0.8| as a medium eﬀect, ≥|0.2| but <|0.5| as a small
eﬀect, and <|0.2| is regarded as a negligible eﬀect ( Chen et al.,
2010).
The initial steps of the analysis will involve constructing
a network evidence plot to visualize the direct and indirect
relationships between diﬀerent exercise interventions. The
thicknessofthelinesintheplotwillbeproportionaltothenumber
of related studies, and interventions with larger sample sizes
will be represented by larger nodes. For closed-loop evidence
networks, consistency testing will be performed using the node-
splitting method. If the P-value exceeds 0.05, it indicates good
consistency between the interventions. For interventions without
direct comparisons, indirect assessments will be made using the
network meta-analysis framework. Additionally, the cumulative
ranking (SUCRA) values for each intervention comparison will be
calculatedtoranktheireﬀects.ASUCRAvaluecloseto1indicates

/three.tnum./two.tnum Risk assessment results of literature bias
In this study, we used the RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools to assess
the risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-
randomized studies, respectively. Among the 13 RCTs, only two
studieshadalowriskofbiasinallevaluationareas.Approximately
60% of the RCTs had some concerns or a high risk of bias.
For the four non-randomized studies included, controlling for
confounding factors was the main limitation. Two of these studies
were rated as high risk. However, the selection of participants and
classiﬁcation of interventions were handled well, both showing
a low risk of bias. It is important to note that non-randomized
studies also had some limitations in outcome measurement
and reporting, with about 50% of these studies showing some
issues. Due to the nature of the intervention, it was diﬃcult to
implement double-blinding for both participants and researchers.
Additionally, monitoring and quantifying exercise adherence was
challenging, which may have aﬀected the standardization of the
intervention(see AppendixTables1 ,2).
/three.tnum./three.tnum Results of data analysis
The network meta-analysis assessed the impact of various
exercise interventions on working memory in children with
ADHD. The results indicated a moderate eﬀect of exercise
interventions on working memory. To validate the robustness of
the analysis, an inconsistency network model was employed toexamine the overall consistency between both pairwise and multi-
armdirectandindirecteﬀectssimultaneously.Furthermore,model
convergence was evaluated using the potential scale reduction
factor (PSRF), with results approaching 1, indicating robust
convergence(see AppendixFigures1 ,2).
The ﬁndings showed minimal diﬀerences in the deviance
information criterion (DIC) between the consistency model and
the inconsistency model, with a diﬀerence of <5, suggesting no
signiﬁcant disparity between the two models, and no evident
inconsistency (see AppendixFigure3 ). The loop inconsistency
model was used to assess the A-B-D loop, revealing an
inconsistency factor (IF) of 0.036, standard error (seIF) of 0.517,
a z-value of 0.070, and a p-value of 0.944, with a 95% conﬁdence
interval of (0.00, 1.05). Since the p-value was >0.05 and
the conﬁdence interval included 0, it suggests no signiﬁcant
inconsistency between direct and indirect eﬀects within the loop.
Moreover, the heterogeneity within the loop was 0.064, indicating
lowheterogeneity,furthersupportingtheconsistencyofdirectand
indirect evidence within the loop (see AppendixFigure4 ). The
adjusted funnel plot showed no signiﬁcant publication bias (see
AppendixFigure5 ).

between the control group and cognitive-aerobic exercise, and
simple aerobic exercise, indicating more extensive data for these

Based on the forest plot and SUCRA ranking analysis,
signiﬁcantdiﬀerenceswereobservedintheeﬀectivenessofvarious
exercise interventions in improving working memory in children
with ADHD. The network meta-analysis revealed a moderate

aerobicexercisedemonstratingthemostsigniﬁcanteﬀect(SMD =
0.72, 95% CI: 0.44–1.00) and the highest SUCRA value (75.21%).
Ball sports ranked second with a moderate to high improvement
eﬀect (SMD =0.61, 95% CI: −0.12–1.35) and a SUCRA value of
61.28%. Mind-body exercises (SMD =0.50, 95% CI: −0.04–1.04,
SUCRA=55.46%) and interactive games (SMD =0.37, 95% CI:
−0.03–0.78, SUCRA =44.91%) showed moderate eﬀects. Simple
aerobic exercise exhibited a smaller improvement eﬀect (SMD =
0.40, 95% CI: 0.19–0.60) with a SUCRA value of 44.28%, while the
controlgroupshowedminimalimprovement(SUCRA =10.53%).
These results highlight the superior eﬀectiveness of cognitive-
aerobic exercise in enhancing working memory in children with
ADHD, followed by ball sports and mind-body exercises (see
Figures3,4).
To explore potential moderators of the intervention eﬀects, a
meta-regression analysis was conducted, incorporating variables
such as the mean age of participants, gender ratio, weekly
intervention frequency, total intervention duration, session
duration, and overall intervention period. The results indicated
that none of these factors signiﬁcantly moderated the eﬀect of
exercise interventions, further conﬁrming the robustness of the
ﬁndings(see AppendixFigure6 ).
In this study, the meta-regression analysis aimed to examine
potential moderators inﬂuencing the exercise intervention eﬀects
by including the following variables in the model: year of
publication (the time the study was conducted), participant
age (age distribution of children with ADHD), gender ratio
(gendercomposition),weeklyinterventionfrequency(thenumber
of interventions per week), total intervention time (overall
duration of the intervention), session duration (duration of each
intervention), and total intervention period (the overall duration
of the intervention program). The purpose of incorporating
these variables was to assess how diﬀerent experimental designs
and population characteristics might moderate the eﬀects of
exercise interventions, thereby conﬁrming the robustness of the
study’sresults.
The analysis revealed that, with the exception of weekly
intervention frequency and total intervention time, which
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the eﬀects of cognitive-aerobic exercise,
the other variables (including year of publication, participant age,
gender ratio, session duration, and total intervention period) did
not signiﬁcantly moderate the eﬀect of exercise interventions.
Speciﬁcally, the results showed that increased weekly intervention
frequency and total intervention time signiﬁcantly enhanced the
eﬀect of cognitive-aerobic exercise in improving working memoryin children with ADHD. This suggests that the eﬀectiveness of
cognitive-aerobic exercise may depend on higher intervention
frequencyandlongercumulativeinterventionduration.
In summary, cognitive-aerobic exercise and ball sports
were found to be the most eﬀective in improving working
memory in children with ADHD, while the eﬀect of simple
aerobic exercise was more limited. The network meta-analysis
integrated both direct and indirect evidence, ensuring the
robustness of the results. By combining eﬀect sizes with
cumulative ranking values (SUCRA), researchers can gain a
clearer understanding of the strength and relative priority of
diﬀerent interventions. However, some interventions exhibited
wider conﬁdence intervals for eﬀect sizes, suggesting that the
results may be inﬂuenced by sample size and heterogeneity of
the interventions. Future studies could consider increasing sample
sizes and improving intervention designs to enhance the precision
and consistency of the ﬁndings. Additionally, sensitivity analyses
and publication bias tests indicated that the results of this study
were relatively robust, providing support for the reliability of the
interventioneﬀects.
/four.tnum Discussion
Based on the cumulative probability ranking and coverage
area shown in Figure5, signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist in the eﬀects
of various types of exercise interventions on improving working
memory in children with ADHD. In the SUCRA cumulative
probability analysis, a larger coverage area indicates a higher rank
in terms of intervention eﬀectiveness, meaning the intervention
has a stronger eﬀect on enhancing working memory. From the
ﬁgure, it can be observed that cognitive-aerobic exercise has the
largest coverage area at 75.21%, indicating that this intervention
is the most eﬀective among all types. This larger coverage area
suggests that cognitive-aerobic exercise has a clear advantage in
improving working memory in children with ADHD. Following
closely is ball sports, with a coverage area of 61.28%, also
showing a good improvement eﬀect. Mind-body exercises have
a coverage area of 55.46%, ranking third, indicating a moderate
improvementeﬀect.Interactivegamesandsimpleaerobicexercises
have relatively smaller coverage areas, at 44.91% and 44.28%,
respectively, suggesting that their eﬀects on improving working
memory are more moderate. Finally, the control group has
the smallest coverage area, at only 10.53%, showing almost
noimprovement.
Thesediﬀerencesincoverageareasreﬂectthevaryingcognitive
load, executive demands, and complexity involved in each type of
exercise intervention. The disparity in results may stem from the
distinct cognitive demands of diﬀerent exercise types on children
with ADHD and the degree to which they activate executive
functions. Cognitive-aerobic exercise shows the most signiﬁcant
eﬀect (SMD =0.72), which may be because this type of exercise
combines the dual demands of aerobic activity and cognitive
tasks, requiring children to continuously process information,
maintain focus, and perform complex cognitive operations during
the exercise ( Yu et al., 2018 ;McDaniel et al., 2014 ). Cognitive-
aerobicexercisemayinvolvetaskswithrulesandobjectives,which
increase the load on the prefrontal cortex, making it highly active

inmultitaskingsituations( Kochetal.,2020 ).Theprefrontalcortex
is closely associated with working memory, and this sustained
cognitive stimulation helps improve working memory function
(Curtis and D’Esposito, 2003 ). Furthermore, cognitive-aerobic
exercise may involve repeated cognitive switching, decision-
making, and memory retrieval, which eﬀectively trains children’s
ability to retain and update information, thus showing signiﬁcant
eﬀects in enhancing working memory ( Soltani Kouhbanani and
Rothenberger,2021 ).
Ball sports rank second in eﬀectiveness (SMD =0.61),
and their positive impact on working memory may stem fromthe strategic and team-oriented demands of these sports. For
example, sports such as soccer or basketball typically require
children to remain highly focused in dynamic and competitive
situations, while also remembering and analyzing the actions
of teammates and opponents, which places a high demand on
task memory. In ball sports, children not only need to plan
and execute movements but also continuously adjust strategies
and predict the opponent’s actions. These multitasking and real-
time adjustment characteristics directly exercise their working
memory load, information storage, and response speed ( Ishihara
andMizuno,2018 ;Ishiharaetal.,2017 ).

Incontrast,mind-bodyexercises(SMD =0.50)andinteractive
games (SMD =0.37) show moderate eﬀects. This is likely because
theseactivitiesmaybemoresigniﬁcantinimprovingattentionand
emotional regulation but present relatively lower direct challenges
to executive functions and cognitive load ( Wang et al., 2023 ).
Mind-body exercises such as yoga and Tai Chi typically emphasize
concentration, breath control, and relaxation. Studies have shown
that such exercises help reduce anxiety levels in children with
ADHDandenhancethestabilityoftheirattention( Wuetal.,2013 ;
Rao et al., 2019 ). While these eﬀects indirectly improve working
memory,theymaylackthehighcognitiveloadstimulationrequired
for direct improvements. Virtual sports-based interactive games
primarily focus on enhancing children’s social interaction and
cooperation experiences, such as motivating participants through
collaborative tasks or fun competitions in virtual environments.
Althoughthesegameshaveapositiveimpactonthesocialbehavior
and emotional regulation of children with ADHD ( Ochi et al.,
2024;Zhao et al., 2022 ), their lower task complexity and memory
load requirements mean they are less eﬀective than cognitive-
aerobic exercise and ball sports in directly improving working
memory. The cognitive challenges in these games are limited and
generally do not involve high-intensity memory tasks or complex
decision-making, making their direct impact on working memory
relativelymodest.
On the other hand, the eﬀect of regular aerobic exercise
is the weakest (SMD =0.40), which may be attributed to its
simpler exercise format and lower cognitive load. Activities like
runningandskipping,whileimprovingoverallphysicalﬁtnessand
stimulating dopamine secretion, can help children with ADHDmaintain attention in the short term ( Kuo et al., 2024 ;Ren
et al., 2024 ). However, since they lack demands for memory and
multitasking, they are often insuﬃcient to activate the prefrontal
cortex’sexecutivefunctionareas.Asaresult,theirdirectimpacton
workingmemoryisrelativelysmall.
Compared to existing studies, this network meta-analysis is
the ﬁrst to systematically evaluate the eﬀects of diﬀerent exercise
interventions on working memory in children with ADHD. Our
ﬁndings revealed that cognitive-aerobic exercise showed the most
signiﬁcant improvement (SMD =0.72, 95% CI: 0.44–1.00). This
eﬀect size is notably larger than that reported in a recent meta-
analysis of pure aerobic exercise (SMD =0.48, 95% CI: 0.02–
0.95). The diﬀerence suggests a potential synergistic eﬀect when
cognitive tasks are integrated into aerobic exercise. Our study
identiﬁed intervention frequency and total duration as key factors
aﬀectinginterventionoutcomes.Thisalignswith Yangetal.(2024) ’s
ﬁndings, which emphasized the eﬀectiveness of exercise programs
lasting 6–12 weeks with 60–90min per session. Previous research
hasprimarilyfocusedonsingletypesofexercise.Forinstance, Sun
etal.(2024) onlyexaminedstructuredphysicalexercise.Incontrast,
oursystematiccomparisonofvariousexercisetypesprovidesmore
comprehensive guidance for clinical practice. Notably, our results
indicate that ball games may have considerable beneﬁcial eﬀects
(SMD=0.61). This ﬁnding has received limited attention in
previous research. It opens new directions for future studies in
thisﬁeld.
In summary, these diﬀerences may reﬂect variations in
cognitive load, executive demands, and the degree of prefrontal
cortex activation across diﬀerent types of exercise interventions,

leading to signiﬁcantly diﬀerent eﬀects on the improvement of
working memory in children with ADHD. Cognitive-aerobic
exercise and ball sports, due to their higher cognitive demands
and dynamic complexity, have been more eﬀective in promoting
improvements in working memory ( Jacobson and Matthaeus,
2014). In contrast, mind-body exercises and interactive games,
which emphasize emotional regulation and simple social tasks,
show moderate eﬀects. Regular aerobic exercise, due to its
more straightforward physical activity format, has the smallest
impact on working memory improvement. These ﬁndings
suggest that when designing exercise interventions for children
with ADHD, priority should be given to exercise types with
higher cognitive load in order to more eﬀectively enhance
workingmemory.
Although this study reveals the diﬀerences in the eﬀectiveness
of various exercise interventions in improving working memory
in children with ADHD, several limitations remain. For instance,
the underlying mechanisms of these interventions have not
been thoroughly explored, and there is a lack of long-term
follow-up data. Additionally, there is considerable heterogeneity
among the samples, and children of diﬀerent ages or with
varying levels of symptom severity may respond diﬀerently to
the interventions. These ﬁndings have important theoretical and
practical implications. Future research should further explore the
speciﬁc mechanisms by which diﬀerent types of exercise aﬀect
working memory, such as through neuroimaging techniques to
understand the advantages of cognitive-aerobic exercise and ball
sports. For practical implementation, we recommend integrating
structured physical activities into daily classroom routines, such
as incorporating cognitive-motor exercises between lessons or
using active learning strategies that combine physical movement
with cognitive tasks. School administrators should consider
providing professional development opportunities for teachers to
eﬀectively implement these interventions, while clinicians could
incorporate combined cognitive-physical exercises into treatment
protocols with individualized intensity based on symptom
severity. Future studies should conduct individualized analyses
to explore how diﬀerent subgroups respond to various exercise
interventions, assess the long-term sustainability of intervention
eﬀects, and test their feasibility in real classroom settings.
Additionally, optimizing the frequency, intensity, and duration
of interventions through interdisciplinary collaboration would
help maximize improvements in working memory. These eﬀorts
would collectively advance both the theoretical understanding
and practical application of exercise interventions for children
withADHD.
/five.tnum Conclusion
Concluding, this study used network meta-analysis to
investigate the eﬀects of diﬀerent types of exercise interventions
on working memory in children with ADHD. The results indicate
that cognitive-aerobic exercise and ball sports are signiﬁcantly
more eﬀective than other types of exercise interventions in
improving working memory. This diﬀerence may be attributed
to the varying cognitive load, task complexity, and the degree of
activation of executive functions across diﬀerent exercise types.The ﬁndings suggest that when designing exercise interventions
forchildrenwithADHD,priorityshouldbegiventoexercisetypes
with higher cognitive load in order to more eﬀectively enhance
workingmemory.

Abstract: Attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most frequent neurode-
velopmental disorders in childhood and adolescence. Choosing the right treatment is critical to
controlling and improving symptoms. An innovative ADHD treatment is neurofeedback (NF) that
trains participants to self-regulate brain activity. The aim of the study was to analyze the effects of NF
interventions in children with ADHD. A systematic review was carried out in the CINAHL, Medline
(PubMed), Proquest, and Scopus databases, following the PRISMA recommendations. Nine articles
were found. The NF improved behavior, allowed greater control of impulsivity, and increased sus-
tained attention. In addition, it improved motor control, bimanual coordination and was associated
with a reduction in theta waves. NF combined with other interventions such as medication, physical
activity, behavioral therapy training, or attention training with brain–computer interaction, reduced
primary ADHD symptoms. Furthermore, more randomized controlled trials would be necessary to
determine the signiﬁcant effects.

1. Introduction
Attention deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hyperkinetic disorder is one of
the most common mental disorders in childhood and adolescence [ 1]. It is a neurodevelop-
mental disorder characterized by primary symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and/or
impulsivity [ 2]. There are three types of ADHD, inattentive, hyperactive-impulsive, and
combined type [3]. Worldwide, its prevalence is 5.8% [2,4].
There are different genetic and environmental factors among the causes of atten-
tion deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder. ADHD tends to run in families, with a risk of 5 to
10 times higher among ﬁrst-degree relatives [ 5]. Regarding environmental factors, these
mainly include prenatal and perinatal risk factors (maternal stress, smoking or alcohol
consumption during pregnancy, low birth weight, prematurity), environmental toxins
(organophosphates, polychlorinated biphenyls, lead) and unfavorable psychosocial condi-
tions (maternal hostility, severe deprivation in early childhood) [5].
Throughout childhood, ADHD is related to inattention, poor planning ability, and
impulsivity, causing further deterioration as external demands increase [ 6]. This generates
a series of alterations in personal, school, and social functionality, which lead the individual
in the full stage of formation of his personality and identity, to interact in an erroneous way

with society, causing conﬂicts with the environment (parents, siblings, colleagues) and that
fact can lead to social marginalization [ 7,8]. These children, from preschool to 13 years of
age, show a risk of suicidal ideation almost six times greater than that of a child without
ADHD [2,9].
Therefore, early interventions in children are essential, in order to reduce the reper-
cussions in adolescence and adulthood. Among the effective treatments available for
ADHD, the main differences are related to the type of intervention (pharmacological and
non-pharmacological), the age of the patient, the cost, the available patient and caregiver
time, the expected effectiveness in the reduction of symptoms, the adverse effects, safety,
and tolerability [10,11].
The main treatment for ADHD continues to be pharmacological, with psychostimulant
drugs (methylphenidate or amphetamines) being the most widely used [ 12]. However, the
beneﬁts are limited due to frequent adverse effects such as decreased appetite, headache,
and insomnia, as well as poor adherence to treatment [ 5]. This fact makes many families
reject the medication [13].
Among the different non-pharmacological treatment strategies, neurofeedback (NF)
has been considered an innovative ADHD treatment [ 14]. NF is a computer-based behavior
training enabling a patient to self-regulate aspects of brain activity [ 15]. The training
protocols followed in ADHD procedures are training of slow cortical potentials (SCPs),
theta/beta wave training and sensory-motor rhythm training (SMR) [16].
The NF focuses mainly on improving self-control over patterns of brain activity,
decreasing theta waves (low frequency waves related to decreased alertness), and/or
increasing beta waves (high frequency waves related to concentration and neuronal ex-
citability) [ 17,18]. This is achieved by measuring the activity of the electroencephalography
(EEG) while the patient performs a task, often a simple computer game, that modulates
performance and reward according to speciﬁc changes in the EEG pattern [19].
Some systematic reviews have analyzed the positive effects of non-pharmacological
interventions [ 20,21], and other studies have compared the effects of NF interventions
versus psychostimulants [ 22]. Also, in the last years, a meta-analysis in children and
adolescents suggested sustained symptom reductions over time after NF interventions [ 16].
However, the age range of the study population was large and the authors indicated serious
limitations related to the scarcity of studies found and short-terms follow-up. Recently, an
increasing number of studies investigating NF interventions with longer follow-up have
been published, so researching the latest evidence can provide more information about
this population. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to analyze the effects of
interventions with NF exclusively in children with ADHD.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design and Search Strategy
A systematic review was performed following the guidelines of the PRISMA statement
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) [23].
The search was carried out through the following databases: CINAHL, Medline
(via PubMed), Proquest, and Scopus. The search equation using the Mesh terms was
“Child AND attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder AND neurofeedback”. The search was
conducted in June 2021.
2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized controlled trials, (2) children sample (up
to 13 years), (3) NF as a treatment for ADHD, (4) comparison of NF with a controlled group
or other interventions, (5) published in English or Spanish, (6) published in the last 5 years.
The exclusion criteria were: (1) no randomization, (2) mixed samples (adults and chil-
dren) or adult population sample, (3) interventions without NF, (4) only NF interventions
without a control group or other interventions.",paper15.pdf,2

2.3. Study Selection, Quality Appraisal, and Risk of Bias
The selection of articles was carried out in three steps. The title and abstract were read
ﬁrst, followed by reading the full text. Finally, a critical reading of the studies was carried
out to assess the methodological quality and risk of bias.
The quality of the included studies was assessed following the levels of evidence and
grades of recommendation by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM) [ 24].
Risk of bias was analyzed by pairs of independent reviewers following the standards in
the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool for clinical trials [25].
2.4. Data Abstraction
First, two authors independently reviewed the title and abstract of the articles found.
Second full text was read. A third author was consulted in case of disagreement.
To extract the data from each study, a data collection table was created. The variables
obtained in the selected articles were: (1) author, year of publication, country; (2) design;
(3) sample size; (4) aim; (5) type of intervention, duration, and follow-up; (6) main results.
3. Results
3.1. Study Characteristics
The initial search provided 332 articles. After removing duplicates and those that did
not meet the inclusion criteria, a total of n= 9 studies were included. The study selection
process is shown in Figure 1.

3.2. Training through NF: Slow Cortical Potentials (SCP), Sensory-Motor Rhythm Training
(SMR), and Theta-Beta Waves
Comparing the clinical efﬁcacy of the NF-SCP and the computerized cognitive training
(CogT), an improvement was found in the symptomatology perceived by parents and
teachers after training. Furthermore, the effect of NF-SMR combined with game-based
CogT in children with ADHD showed positive therapeutic effects on brain waves, except
for sensory motor activity (no signiﬁcant changes in the waves of frontocentral zero) as
well as an improvement in symptomatology [32].
On the other hand, it is found that NF-SMR training improved motor control and
more speciﬁcally bimanual coordination among children with ADHD [ 31]. In addition, a
reduction in theta waves in the right and left hemispheres was recorded in participants
with NF condition (t (17) = 3.73, p< 0.01 for the left hemisphere and t (17) = 3.97, p< 0.01
for right hemisphere) [ 28], although it was not recommended for the use of theta/beta
training as an independent and exclusive treatment to improve neurocognitive functioning
in children with ADHD [27].
3.3. Neurofeedback vs. Drug Treatment
Comparing NF with methylphenidate (MPH) treatment, teachers reported signiﬁ-
cantly lower ADHD symptoms in the group MPH, but there were no differences between
groups in parental report [ 34]. In addition, it was observed that the combined treatment
NF and MPH, improved ADHD symptoms ( p= 0.01), being more effective compared to
single medication treatment [ 26]. Some authors point out that NF improved attention, hy-
peractivity, and impulsivity while drug treatment improved visual attention capacity [ 30].
Although, on the other hand, other authors did not ﬁnd superior effects of combined NF on
intelligent functioning compared to the medication treatment only [ 28], and others found
that stimulant medication showed superior effects over NF to improve neurocognitive
functioning [27].
3.4. Neurofeedback vs. Other Interventions
Some papers compared the effects of NF with a physical activity intervention [ 27,33].
Combining both methods, NF plus physical activity, improved attention and short/long-
term memory, although NF seem to lead to better and broader progress [ 33]. Other authors
did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant beneﬁts [27].
Analyzing NF and the behavioral therapy intervention, some authors found that both
treatments achieved improvement on response control and attention [30].
Finally, comparing the NF with attention training based on the brain–computer in-
terface, an improvement was found in inattentive symptoms in ADHD children, being an
option for treating milder cases or as an adjunctive treatment (difference between groups
of 1.6; 95% CI 0.3 to 2.9 p= 0.0177) [29].
4. Discussion
ADHD is one of the most common neurological disorders in childhood. Although
there are different therapeutic interventions, the goal of this research was to evaluate the
efﬁcacy of NF interventions in children.
NF improved the symptomatology in children with ADHD, because of learning
through video games, attending to their mistakes, and training functions nonconscious
control—such as attention, achievement of objectives, self-control, and self-regulation of
attention levels, and concentration—in addition to inhibiting distracting stimuli [ 35]. Also,
it was found evidence of comparative effectiveness of NF and CogT for children with
ADHD. As other studies point out, NF is a treatment with great beneﬁts due to its positive
and lasting effect on symptoms [ 3], signiﬁcantly improving behaviour, attention, IQ [ 36,37],
and reaction times on the psychometric measures such as hyperactivity and impulsivity
symptoms [37].",paper15.pdf,9
"J. Clin. Med. 2021 ,10, 3797 10 of 13
In addition, another of the beneﬁts found was the improvement in motor control and
bimanual coordination. ADHD in children is often associated with poor motor control, co-
ordination problems, and difﬁculty controlling strength [ 38], which affects the performance
of distal, complex, and accelerated tasks that lead to poor writing and poor academic
performance [39].
It seems that the NF is related to a reduction in theta waves, although the results were
not clear. Literature also shows divergences, some authors found signiﬁcant individual
learning curves for both theta and beta over the course of the intervention, although
individual learning curves were not signiﬁcantly correlated with behavioral changes [ 37,40].
Other authors provided evidence that children with ADHD learned to decrease theta/beta
ratio during NF sessions being the learning effects mainly attributable to the increase in
the power of the beta waves both, in the group level sessions and in the individual level
sessions. However, it is unknown whether the decrease in theta waves is attributed to the
efﬁcacy of NF sessions or to developmental changes in children [40].
Regarding drug treatment, NF is considered a viable alternative therapy for speciﬁc
groups of children with ADHD who do not respond to medication or have severe side
effects [ 5,22]. The combined use of drugs and NF enhances the durability of the positive
effects [ 17] and even other studies corroborate that multimodal treatment of NF plus
stimulant medication at low doses was positive in improving symptoms such as inattention
and hyperactivity [ 22]. As other studies point out, drug doses can be reduced when both
treatments are administered [3,41].
Alternative therapies combining NF plus physical activity improved attention and
short/long-term memory. Other studies indicate great beneﬁts in the improvement of
cognitive, behavioral and physical symptoms after mixed physical exercise programs,
particularly moderate to intense aerobic exercise [ 42,43]. Indeed, physical exercise generates
an increase in the levels of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine [ 44], which translates
into the better motor and cognitive functioning and greater control of executive functions
and impulses, so many authors bet on complementing NF and physical activity [45].
Behavioral therapy with NF improved response and attention control, as pointed
out by other authors [ 46]. Even other studies indicate that NF through video game-based
cognitive training normalizes brain function in patients with ADHD, since these therapeutic
interventions are generally effective in improving cognitive areas and producing a decrease
in symptoms of ADHD [47].
NF combinate with the training of attention based on the brain–computer interface
shows beneﬁts in inattentive symptoms, even some authors indicate that this type of
training program is beneﬁcial in cases of ADHD that present more severe symptoms [48].
One promising aspect of NF is its relationship to procedural learning, so its beneﬁts
can be more durable over time after treatment. Technology development provides different
treatment options, combining traditional drug treatment, along with NF, physical activity,
or cognitive training, all strategies provide positive therapeutic effects on brainwaves and
ADHD symptomatology.
Although NF can be used as complementary in patients who have signiﬁcant side
effects to stimulant medication or in patients whose family refuses to try the medication,
further research is needed to corroborate its effects in each of the behavioural areas of the
children with ADHD.
Limitations
This study had a number of limitations to be acknowledged. First, although all
studies use NF as an intervention, the great variability in the duration of the intervention
may inﬂuence the heterogeneity of the results. Also, the sample sizes of the controlled
randomized trial were small. Future research would be necessary to analyze the NF effects
in each of the behavior areas of children with ADHD. Furthermore, more randomized
controlled trials would be necessary to determine the signiﬁcant effects and the duration of
the effects over time.",paper15.pdf,10

5. Conclusions
NF showed a signiﬁcant improvement of the symptoms in children with ADHD.
This treatment improved behavior, allowed greater control of impulsivity, and increased
sustained attention. In addition, it improved motor control, bimanual coordination, and
was associated with a reduction in theta waves. NF combined with other interventions
such as drugs, physical activity, behavioral therapy training, or attention training with
brain–computer reduced primary ADHD symptoms. However, more scientiﬁc evidence is
needed to support its efﬁcacy and greater implantation in clinical practice.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurode-
velopmental disorder characterized by elevated motor activity, impulsivity, and attention deficit.
Approximately 5% of the population suffers from this disorder. Among the key explanations of
ADHD, executive functions play an important role in understanding the symptomatology present in
this disorder and in determining the main treatment strategies for affected patients. We present a sys-
tematic review that seeks to identify the treatment methods developed to support executive functions
in individuals with ADHD. Methods: Articles were analyzed in the SCOPUS, PUBMED, and Science
Direct databases. Initially, 739 articles were found. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria,
30 articles remained and were included in the data extraction process. Results: Among the primary
treatments identified, 14 studies propose psychological training for executive functions, 9 studies
recommend medication, 5 studies suggest digital interventions, and 1 study advocates for sports as
beneficial for executive functions. Conclusions: The data are discussed around the need to develop
new proposals to enhance the executive functions of individuals with ADHD, thereby improving
their performance in educational, personal, social, and family activities impacted by this disorder.
Keywords: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; executive functions; treatment
1. Introduction
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These symptoms often manifest in childhood
and can persist into adolescence and adulthood [ 1]. The global prevalence of ADHD ranges
from 5.9% to 7.1% in children and 1.2% to 7.3% in adults, indicating its significant impact
across different age groups [2,3].
However, prevalence rates of ADHD can vary based on ethnic differences. Contrary
to previous beliefs, recent studies contradict the notion that the prevalence of ADHD is
lower in certain ethnic groups. For instance, while it was once thought that Black children
and adolescents had lower rates of ADHD compared to their White counterparts, research
has shown that the prevalence rates between these groups do not significantly differ [ 4].
Moreover, Asian and Latino children and adolescents tend to present lower prevalence
rates of ADHD than both their Black and White counterparts. These differences may
be influenced by factors such as access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, and cultural
attitudes toward mental health [5].
ADHD is a disorder of multifactorial origin, with the following most commonly de-
scribed causal factors in the literature: genetic predispositions, gestational and perinatal
factors, and environmental influences [ 2]. Changes in brain structure and function are

observed in individuals with ADHD, affecting mechanisms such as neurogenesis and
synaptogenesis, which, in turn, disrupt attention and impulse control, core functions regu-
lated by the central nervous system [ 3]. The etiology of ADHD is diverse, with interactions
between genetic and environmental factors contributing to the heterogeneous manifesta-
tion of the disorder among individuals and subsequently influencing their response to
interventions [6].
This disagreement on the causes can contribute to a clash in treatment processes, which,
in turn, impacts both academic and familial spheres. In the academic realm, for instance,
children with ADHD may struggle to concentrate, follow instructions, and complete tasks,
thereby affecting their academic performance and self-esteem [ 7]. Within the family, the
lack of understanding about the nature of the disorder can generate stress and frustration,
increasing tensions at home. This situation will affect the support networks available to
a child with ADHD in their close environment since the specific needs of this population
require collaborative efforts [8].
Individuals diagnosed with ADHD can encounter several challenges in their daily
lives across various domains. In childhood and adolescence, ADHD can significantly
impact academic achievement, social interactions, and overall well-being. Symptoms of
ADHD, such as inattention and hyperactivity, often persist into adolescence, leading to
difficulties in peer relationships, academic performance, and behavioral challenges. An
estimated 72% of adolescents with ADHD present with sleep problems [ 9,10]. This affects
their daytime functioning and exacerbates symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity.
Moreover, untreated ADHD in adolescence increases susceptibility to risky behaviors,
substance misuse, and mental health issues, including depression [11–13].
In adulthood, individuals with ADHD can face occupational challenges, educational
impairments, financial difficulties, and family instability [ 14]. They are less likely to
graduate from high school and college, have lower job stability, and demonstrate impaired
job performance. ADHD also contributes to higher rates of substance abuse, mental health
disorders, and financial stress, leading to increased reliance on public aid and decreased
income [15,16].
Moreover, individuals with ADHD often experience comorbid conditions, such as
anxiety disorders, significantly higher than the general population [ 17]. Anxiety symptom
severity is associated with lower social skills and higher social problems in young people
with ADHD, exacerbating existing social difficulties. Additionally, challenges with emo-
tional regulation are common among individuals with ADHD, characterized by difficulties
in managing and expressing emotions effectively. Studies indicate that adults with ADHD
exhibit lower emotional regulation scores compared to controls, utilizing non-adaptive
emotion regulation strategies such as self-blame and rumination. Emotional dysregulation
is associated with greater socio-functional impairment, impacting relationships, stress man-
agement, and coping abilities. Addressing comorbid conditions and emotional regulation
challenges is crucial for comprehensive support and intervention to mitigate the impact of
ADHD [18,19].
One of the most widely accepted theories explaining the essential cause of ADHD
symptomatology states that children, adolescents, or adults with this disorder present an
immature executive function development [ 20]. Executive functions are a set of high-level
mental abilities that help us plan, organize, and control behavior to achieve goals [ 21]. There
is no specific number of executive functions and there are proposals that consider them as a
single factor or multiple skills that interact to achieve behavioral regulation [ 22]. Different
authors propose that there are different executive functions: inhibitory control, working
memory, planning, verification, decision-making, emotional regulation, and cognitive
flexibility [23–25].
In ADHD, the main executive function that is thought to be affected is inhibitory
control. This impairment generates a domino effect, causing difficulties with working
memory capacity, internal language regulating behavior, reconstitution of new behaviors,
regulation of emotion, and arousal and motivation [ 26]. This alteration of the executive",paper16.pdf,2
"J. Clin. Med. 2024 ,13, 4208 3 of 17
functions is what causes ADHD to present as a lack of regulation of behavior and cognition.
This generates problems affecting individuals diagnosed with this disorder in different
spheres, such as the educational, family, personal, social, work, and others [27–29].
The need to work on executive functions in ADHD is a crucial aspect of the manage-
ment of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Over the years, various strategies have been
explored to address these functions, which play a fundamental role in the regulation of
behavior, attention, planning, and decision-making in individuals with ADHD. Among
the most common interventions is the use of stimulant medications such as psychostimu-
lants, which have been shown to improve attention and reduce hyperactive and impulsive
symptoms in many patients. However, while these medications may be effective for some
individuals, they are not a definitive solution as they do not directly address executive
function deficits [30].
Another important approach is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which focuses
on identifying and changing dysfunctional patterns of thinking and behavior. CBT can be
beneficial in improving skills such as self-regulation, problem-solving, and organization,
which are directly related to executive functions. In addition, neuropsychological therapy,
which focuses on rehabilitating specific areas of cognitive functioning, shows great potential
for the treatment of ADHD. Through activities designed to improve working memory,
cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control, we seek to strengthen executive functions and
improve overall functioning [31].
However, despite advances in these approaches, there is still no clear consensus on
what is the best strategy for addressing impaired executive functions in ADHD. Research
has shown mixed results leaving as a consequence many unanswered questions. Therefore,
it is crucial to conduct a systematic review that integrates the most recent findings and
evaluates the relative effectiveness of various interventions that address executive functions
in people with ADHD.
This review could help inform clinical practice and guide the development of more
effective and personalized future research that addresses the specific needs of each individ-
ual with ADHD. In addition, it would highlight the importance of further research in this
field to improve the quality of life and functioning of individuals affected by this disorder.
2. Materials and Methods
The scope of this research focuses on analyzing systematic reviews by applying the
PRISMA method [ 32]. The first stage involved identifying the research question and
proceeding with data collection. Initially, a total of N = 739 articles were obtained. In
the second stage, duplicate articles (N = 285) were identified and excluded. In the third
stage, the remaining articles were assessed according to the inclusion criteria (human
participation, treatment to improve executive functions, people diagnosed with ADHD,
and articles in English and Spanish) and exclusion criteria (languages other than Spanish
and English, systematic reviews, books or theses, paid access, or articles that proposed
interventions not aimed at improving executive functions in ADHD), resulting in the
exclusion of N = 406 articles. Consequently, in the fourth stage, a selection of N = 32 articles
was made and used in this research. In the fifth stage, the statistical analysis is presented.
Finally, in the sixth stage, the summary collation and dissemination of the results are carried
out through the application of the analytical framework (Figure 1).
To achieve our research objective, we used the following databases: SCOPUS, Science
Direct, and PUBMED using the keywords: executive functions, ADHD, treatment, and
intervention, with the respective Boolean terms (OR, AND). During the research process,
three reviewers supervised: titles, abstracts, and full texts considering the inclusion and
exclusion criteria, thus accepting, or rejecting the discrepancies found in the papers. Con-
sequently, each independent article was combined into a single file, thus adopting the
results of the three reviewers by extracting the files with different results. The extraction
table included data such as authors, research design, year of publication, the sample size
used, type of intervention, intervention time, country of application, tests applied to assess",paper16.pdf,3

The process to obtain the results involved a series of meticulous steps that allowed 
for a comprehensive analysis and understanding of the data. Firstly, dynamic tables were 
used to organize the data in a structured ma nner. These tables provide a dynamic view of 
the items for each variable, facilitating the identi ﬁcation of pa tterns and key relationships 
among the data. Subsequently, speci ﬁc ranges were generated to perform detailed and 
segmented tabulations of the results. These ra nges enabled us to group similar data and 
establish relevant categories for deeper anal ysis. Once the data were organized and ana-
lyzed, the results were visualized through char ts. These charts were designed to visually

In the analysis of the results, there was evidence of improvement in executive functions,
although not uniformly across all aspects. Notably, working memory demonstrated the
highest score in 15 studies, followed by inhibition in 12 studies, and cognitive flexibility in
5 studies. However, processing speed and sustained attention showed the lowest scores,
each with only 1 study. To identify the efficacy of the treatment received with executive
functions, a significant association was found between improving executive functioning
and the type of psychological treatment ( x2= 11.82, p= 0.03). Explore these findings further

tions, although not uniformly across all aspe cts. Notably, working memory demonstrated 
the highest score in 15 studies, followed by inhibition in 12 studies, and cognitive ﬂexibil-
ity in 5 studies. However, processing speed and sustained a ttention showed the lowest 
scores, each with only 1 study. To identify the e ﬃcacy of the treatment received with ex-
ecutive functions, a signi ﬁcant association was found between improving executive func-
tioning and the type of psychological treatment ( x2 = 11.82,  p = 0.03). Explore these ﬁndings 
further in Figure 8.

4. Discussion 
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that a ﬀects the normal development of 
children, adolescents, and adults. It is one of  the most prevalent mental health problems. 
For this reason, it is vital to continue the dialogue on this ma tter and its treatment pro-
cesses, which currently lack consensus on proposals or results [33,34]. 
Within the context of this article, the rese arch based on a quantitative systematic re-
view of treatment methods for executive functi ons in the ADHD population is presented. 
The importance of research on executive functions lies in the central role played by skills, 
such as inhibitory control, working memory, emotional regulation, cognitive ﬂexibility, 
and planning in understanding the problems with the regulation of behavior and cogni-
tion that occur in this disorder [20,26]. 
The research began with 739 articles, and after analyzing the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, 32 studies were included, allowing for the planned analyses to be carried out. The main results identi ﬁed that randomized controlled trials were the most frequently per-
formed research design. Regarding the temporality of studies, it was found that the last 5 
years represent the highest scienti ﬁc production in this line of research. Regarding the 
location of the research, it was found that the largest number of studies were conducted 
in Europe. As for the developmental level at which most studies were carried out, it was during childhood. The most frequently used treatment to support executive functions in 
ADHD was psychological interventions. The executive functions that bene ﬁt most from 
the identi ﬁed treatments are working memory, inhibition, and cognitive ﬂexibility. This 
study contributes to the under standing of ADHD by con ﬁrming the importance of execu-
tive functions when conducting interventions with individuals with this disorder. As pre-
viously mentioned, the roles of functions su ch as inhibitory control, working memory, 
and cognitive ﬂexibility are crucial for individuals with ADHD to improve their behav-
ioral regulation skills. 
The ﬁndings of this systematic review under score the breadth of research exploring 
interventions for ADHD, with particular emphasis on supporting executive functions, which tend to be a ﬀected by this neurodevelopmental disorder. Notably, both psycholog-
ical interventions and pharmacotherapy have received substantial a ttention. For clinicians

4. Discussion
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects the normal development of
children, adolescents, and adults. It is one of the most prevalent mental health problems.
For this reason, it is vital to continue the dialogue on this matter and its treatment processes,
which currently lack consensus on proposals or results [33,34].
Within the context of this article, the research based on a quantitative systematic
review of treatment methods for executive functions in the ADHD population is presented.
The importance of research on executive functions lies in the central role played by skills,
such as inhibitory control, working memory, emotional regulation, cognitive flexibility, and
planning in understanding the problems with the regulation of behavior and cognition that
occur in this disorder [20,26].
The research began with 739 articles, and after analyzing the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, 32 studies were included, allowing for the planned analyses to be carried out.
The main results identified that randomized controlled trials were the most frequently
performed research design. Regarding the temporality of studies, it was found that the last
5 years represent the highest scientific production in this line of research. Regarding the
location of the research, it was found that the largest number of studies were conducted
in Europe. As for the developmental level at which most studies were carried out, it was
during childhood. The most frequently used treatment to support executive functions
in ADHD was psychological interventions. The executive functions that benefit most
from the identified treatments are working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility.
This study contributes to the understanding of ADHD by confirming the importance of
executive functions when conducting interventions with individuals with this disorder. As
previously mentioned, the roles of functions such as inhibitory control, working memory,
and cognitive flexibility are crucial for individuals with ADHD to improve their behavioral
regulation skills.
The findings of this systematic review underscore the breadth of research exploring
interventions for ADHD, with particular emphasis on supporting executive functions,
which tend to be affected by this neurodevelopmental disorder. Notably, both psychological
interventions and pharmacotherapy have received substantial attention. For clinicians",paper16.pdf,8

and healthcare providers navigating treatment options for individuals with ADHD, a
thorough consideration of the available evidence must be conducted. Moreover, tailoring
interventions to suit the developmental stage of the patient is essential to ensure the benefits
seen in the patient’s quality of life. Furthermore, the combination of interventions, such as
medication and psychological therapies, needs careful examination to ensure efficacy is
grounded in empirical evidence.
Beyond treatment modalities, the cultural context emerges as a pivotal factor influ-
encing intervention success. While existing research predominantly emanates from North
America, Europe, and Asia, it is imperative to acknowledge and address the diversity of
cultural backgrounds among individuals seeking treatment worldwide. Adapting interven-
tions to local contexts is crucial for their applicability and efficacy [ 35–37]. This adaptation
process necessitates not only clinical adjustments but also rigorous research to elucidate
the specific cultural nuances that impact treatment engagement and effectiveness [ 38–41].
As such, bridging the gap between research and practice entails a comprehensive under-
standing of the multifaceted influences shaping the experiences of individuals with ADHD
across diverse cultural landscapes.
Future research motivates us to develop our own intervention for executive functions
in the ADHD population. Our interest lies in technological aspects that may be useful,
especially for children and adolescents with the disorder. Finally, it is essential to continue
studying executive functions, as these high-level mental abilities are not only affected in
ADHD but also in other pathologies that affect human mental and behavioral activity and
their pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and multimodal treatments [41–51].
The main limitation of this research lies in the lack of access to all the published
articles, as several documents required payment to download. Another aspect is the
language delimitation, as we only worked with studies published in English and Spanish;
however, in future studies, we will review works published in other languages to cover the
largest number of works on ADHD.

Abstract
This study compared the effects of two metacognitive interventions on writing, working memory (WM), and behavioral
symptoms of students with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The disorder was clinically diagnosed by a
multidisciplinary team according to DSM-IV criteria. The first ap proach consisted of a combined intervention in text production
and WM while the second focused only on WM. Participants were 47 students from the fifth to ninth grades of two public
elementary schools in Porto Alegre (Brazil), randomized to one of the two interventions groups. Writing and WM were
assessed before, immediately after, and 3 months after the interventions. The results suggest that both interventions
contributed to improving behavior and school performance, whereas only the combined intervention increased the
overall quality of narrative text, organization of paragraphs, and denouement.
Keywords: Metacognition, Intervention, Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Text production, Working memory
Background
The high risk of low school performance associated with
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is well
established (American Psychiatric Association, 2014;
DuPaul, Gormley, & Laracy, 2012; Sibley, Altszuler, Mor-
row, & Merrill et al., 2014). Writing seems to be the
most impaired and the least studied skill in this group of
children (Mayes & Calhoun, 2006; Dorneles et al., 2014).
Moreover, a study showed that written expression skills
affect academic performance in other areas much more
than do the intensity of ADHD symptoms, comorbidity
with oppositional defiant disorder, use of medication,
reading ability, and intelligence (Molitor, Langberg, &
Evans, 2016b).
The literature, albeit scar ce, provides evidence of poor
writing performance among ADHD students in childhood
(Re, Pedron, & Cornoldi, 2007; Miranda, Soriano, & Baix-
auli, 2011), adolescence (Molitor et al., 2016a; DeBono et
al., 2012), and young adults (Kim, Lee, & Lee, 2013;Miranda, Baixauli, & Colomer, 2013; Semrud-Clikeman,
2012). The writing of children and young people with
ADHD is shorter, contains more errors, and is of poorer
quality in terms of adequacy, structure, grammar, and lexi-
con, compared to that of their typically developing peers,
and these difficulties affect different age groups (Re et al.,
2007). The quality of the texts is worse even when they
know the basic rules of writin g, compared to peers without
ADHD (Re & Cornoldi, 2010).
The behavioral symptoms of ADHD and/or neuro-
psychological and cognitive deficits, among which working
memory (WM) is included (Sarver, Rapport, Kofler, &
Friedman, 2015; Willcutt, Pennington, Olson, Chhabildas,
& Hulslander, 2005), may contribute to poor performance
in writing expression, as writing involves more than the
simple transcription of thoug hts and concepts and requires
the involvement of a large number of highly complex cog-
nitive processes such as essay planning, the production of
ideas, their organization, th e transcription, and the final
revision, as highlighted by Re et al. (2007).
The cognitive approach to text composition began in the
1980s with Hayes and Flower, who proposed text produc-
tion, involving long-term memory, the environment, and
cognitive processes of planning, translation, and revision* Correspondence: nmtpisacco@uepg.br ;nelbapisacco@yahoo.com.br

"(Berninger, Whitaker, Feng, Swanson, & Abbott, 1996).
Research on the role of WM in writing, conducted since
the 1990s, has shown the processing capabilities of WM to
be heavily involved in the coordination and alternation
between writing processes (Olive, 2012). The WM is a tem-
porary attention-regulated sto rage system that sustains our
capacity for complex thought, such as language, planning,
and problem-solving. It consists of four components: cen-
tral executive, phonological l oop, visuospatial sketchpad,
and episodic buffer (Baddeley, 2012).
Considering the cognitive processes involved in compos-
ition, the study by Miranda et al., (2011) compared the per-
formance of children with ADHD to those with typical
development in written narrative texts. The results indi-
cated that in the text of childre n with the disorder, the plan-
ning process was ineffective, compromising structure,
cohesion, and coherence. Their narratives had fewer words
and phrases, were less complex, and had a greater number
of morphosyntactic, spelling, and presentation errors, indi-
cating poorer performance in the translation process. Lack
of revision or its ineffectiveness contributed to children ’s
failure to detect and correct formal errors and improve
content. Difficulties in writing narratives may persist after
elementary school, since the performance of young adults
with ADHD in narrative texts is often poorer than that of
their peers (Miranda et al., 2013).
The low quality of texts produced by ADHD students
(Re et al., 2007; Re & Cornoldi, 2010; Kim et al., 2013;
Miranda et al., 2011), the high prevalence of this dis-
order in childhood and adolescence (Polanczyk, Lima,
Horta, Biederman, & Rohde, 2007), and the scarcity of
publications on the topic underscore the clear need for
further research on the development and implementa-
tion of interventions designed to facilitate the writing
processes of students with this disorder (Miranda et al.,
2013; Semrud-Clikeman, 2012; Molitor et al., 2016b). In
this context, the question is: what interventions can con-
tribute to improving the writing performance of students
with ADHD?
Any intervention needs to consider how ADHD affects
learning. Deficits in differe nt WM components associated
with ADHD (Martinussen, Hogg-Johnson, & Tannock, 2005)
and poor performance in various writing skills (Graham,
Fishman, Reid, & Hebert, 2016; Alloway, Gathercole, Kirk-
wood, & Elliott, 2009), as well as the relation between cogni-
tive and metacognitive processes involved in text production
and WM (Olive, 2012; Olive, Kellog, & Piolat, 2008;
Berninger et al., 1996), should be considered when
planning an intervention.
Notably, there are two foci of interventions that could
contribute to this purpose. Considering the evidence of the
relation between writing and WM and deficits in ADHD,
interventions that aim to increase WM capacity could even-
tually improve performance in areas such as writing, whichdemand high WM levels. Yet, several WM intervention
studies among children with ADHD have demonstrated
improvement in WM. However, few have reported trans-
fer effects on academic performance (Holmes et al., 2010;
Klingberg, 2010; Gray et al., 2012; Gropper, Gotlieb, Kro-
nitz, & Tannock, 2014). Moreover, the few studies that
presented positive effects on WM capacity with transfer to
school performance (Klingberg et al., 2005; Witt, 2011)
have been criticized for focusing on WM training while
neglecting central executive training (Morrison & Chein,
2011; Rapport, Orban, Kofler, & Friedman, 2013). Another
criticism refers to the fact that the beneficial effects were
specific and momentary, i.e., they were neither maintained
in the long term nor generalized to other contexts, sug-
gesting the need for broader programs or for the combin-
ation of general and specific interventions in the skills to
be improved (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Rapport et
al., 2013).
On the other hand, interventions focusing on writing pro-
cesses that provide the writer with greater automaticity
would relieve the overload on WM, because when a student
automatizes the writing processes, less attention is required
and the demand on working memory diminishes while writ-
ing performance improves. Among the interventions focus-
ing on the cognitive processes o f text production, the self-
regulated strategy development (SRSD) instruction model
developed by Harris and Graham in the 1990s (Graham,
McKeown, Kiuhara, & Harris, 2012) is of particular note.
The results and applications of their study have been revised
several times (Harris, Graham, & Adkins, 2015; Harris,
Graham, & Mason, 2008). The impact of SRSD on the writ-
ing quality produced by students with learning disabilities has
been demonstrated (Graham, Harris, & McKeown, 2013).
SRSD combines the teaching of writing processes through
explicit instruction in general wr iting strategies with specific
strategies of the text genre and the development of self-
regulation strategies, including the establishment of goals,
self-assessment, self-instruction, and self-reinforcement
(Harris, Friedlander, Saddler, Frizzelle, & Graham, 2005).
The strategies are developed in an interactive and individu-
alized manner, and the responsibility for writing is gradually
delegated to the students (Harris et al., 2008).
The SRSD model addresses the WM deficits that are
commonly found in students with ADHD (Jacobson & Reid,
2010; Molitor et al., 2016a; Miranda et al., 2013). In that
model, the explicit teaching of strategies is designed to con-
tribute to (a) reducing the demands on WM during the
w r i t i n go fat e x t ,w h e nu s e di na na u t o m a t e dm a n n e r ;(b )
developing a repertoire of flexible strategies to deal with aca-
demic tasks, which are scarce in children with ADHD; (c)
improving focus and effort with the use of self-regulation
strategies; and (d) setting goals, keeping goals in mind, and
directing the behavior toward achieving them (Harris et al.,
2015). This approach has been demonstrated to be effectivePisacco et al. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica  (2018) 31:5 Page 2 of 15",paper17.pdf,2
"in improving the quality of different text genres among stu-
dents with ADHD (Reid & Lienemann, 2006; Jacobson &
Reid, 2010; La Paz, 2001; Lienemann & Reid, 2008). How-
ever, a review article by Reid, Hagaman, and Graham
(2014)found only 12 studies with ADHD students, totaling
27 participants. Although the interventions demonstrated
significant effects, the limitations of the studies have to be
taken into account: the small nu mber of writing strategies
tested, the small sample sizes, application solely in the con-
text of special education and mostly to individuals, and the
fact the results were measured immediately after the inter-
ventions, with no control of the long-term effect.
The methodological charact eristics of SRSD, described
above, demonstrate the metacognitive focus of this inter-
vention model, in accordance with the four aspects of
metacognition initially proposed by Flavell (1979): metacog-
nitive knowledge (comprises of sensitivity to the self, to the
task and to the strategy and the knowledge of those three
elements), metacognitive experiences, objectives, and ac-
tions or strategies. Use of metacognition in WM
interventions was encountered in the studies by Nunes
(Nunes, Evans, Barros, & Burman, 2011 and Nunes, Barros,
Evans, & Burman, 2014), who found metacognitive inter-
vention to be effective in improving WM; however, the
intervention was not investigated in specific groups of chil-
dren with ADHD. This proposed intervention deserves to
be further investigated as positive effects were found for
metacognitive training with children with ADHD (Asli, Far-
amarzi, Arefi, Farhadi, & Fakkar, 2014). Thus, the central
hypothesis of this study is that we will find greater
improvement regarding specific text production skills and
behavioral symptoms in students with ADHD when using a
combined intervention rather than using a WM interven-
tion alone.
No metacognitive interventions were found to have the
dual focus, i.e., on WM skills and on specific text produc-
tion skills. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative ap-
proach that considers the cogn itive processes involved in
metacognitive interventions in WM and in written
expression. The main aim is to compare the effects of two
metacognitive interventions on writing, school perform-
ance, WM, and behavioral symptoms of elementary school
students with ADHD. One in tervention combines WM
training with specific text production skills, while the other
focuses only on WM.
Method
Design
This experimental comparative intervention research an-
alyzed measures obtained at three different time points:
before, at the end, and 3 months after the intervention.
The sample was randomized into two parallel groups:
the combined intervention group (IG-Combined) and
the WM intervention group (IG-WM).Ethical aspects
The research project was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
The study was conducted after obtaining authorization
from the schools and adherence of teachers and after an in-
formed consent form was signed by the students ’legal
guardians and the students. Individual cases that were
excluded from the sample but showed some ADHD signs
or writing deficits were reported to the guardians. After the
end of the study, the results were presented to the students,
guardians, and schools and the Attention Deficit/Hyper-
activity Program of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre
(ProDAH/HCPA) referred the participants for new clinical
evaluations to determine the need for continued care.
Participants and procedures
The sample was selected out of a population of approxi-
mately 1800 students from two public schools in Porto
Alegre, capital city of Brazil ’ss o u t h e r n m o s ts t a t e .B o t h
schools, covered elementary education, were similar in
curricular proposals, number of students, geographic loca-
tion (downtown area), and socioeconomic characteristics
of the population served (lower middle economic class).
Sample selection, evaluation, and intervention were
carried out at the participating schools (Fig. 1).
The sample consisted of 47 students from the fifth to ninth
grades of elementary school, with mean age of 13.07 years
(SD = 1.78). The inclusion crite ria were Portuguese as main
language; estimated IQ equal to or higher than 80, according
to WISC-IV (Wechsler, 2013), and ADHD diagnosis, accord-
ing to the DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric Associ-
ation, 2002). The exclusion crite ria were intellectual, sensory,
or motor disabilities; autistic spectrum disorder, bipolar
mood disorder, and depression in comorbidity with ADHD;
and alphabetic or spelling phase of writing.
Sample selection: instruments and procedures
The evaluation was carried out by external evaluators, con-
sisting of educational psychologists, psychologists, and psy-
chiatrists from the ProDAH/HC PA multidisciplinary team,
researchers, and doctoral students with experience in the
evaluation of children and adole scents with mental disorders.
The Portuguese version of the SNAP-IV (Mattos,
Pinheiro, Rohde, & Pinto, 2006), validated for Brazilian
samples and largerly used in the country (Caye, Machado,
& Rohde, 2017), was applied to the teachers by education
experts to identify probable cases of ADHD among stu-
dents. It is a questionnaire formulated according to the
DSM-IV criteria for ADHD diagnosis (American Psychi-
atric Association, 2002) that features 18 symptoms (nine
related to inattentiveness and nine associated with hyper-
activity/impulsivity) arranged on a Likert scale. Positive
symptoms are those scored as quite a bit and very much.
SNAP-IV was applied twice, before and soon after thePisacco et al. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica  (2018) 31:5 Page 3 of 15",paper17.pdf,3
"intervention, in order to determine changes in the intensity
of symptoms. On both occasio ns, the questionnaires were
filled out by the same teacher.
The Balanced Dictation test (Moojen, 2011), composed
of 50 words, was applied to determine the performance
in alphabetic-spelling writing, since autonomy over writ-
ing of words is required for text production. The princi-
pal criterion used in selecting the words in the test was
the frequency of the letters in the Portuguese language.
So that, the most common letters and combinations of
letters appeared more frequently (Moojen, 2011).
The selection of this test was based on the possibility of
collective application; its scope to assess the fifth to ninth
elementary school grades and the validation scores that were
obtained from a population with socioeconomic characteris-
tics similar to those of the sam ple, public school students
from low middle class families. The test was used in other
Brazilian studies: Franca, Wolff, Moojen, and Rotta (2004)
used the test to highlight the acquisition of oral language asa predictive factor for the development of spelling; Moura,
Cielo, and Mezzomo (2008)used the test to analyze mistakes
in Portuguese writing of biling ual German-Portuguese chil-
dren; Engelmann and Ferreira (2009) used the test to high-
light the relationship between learning difficulties and
auditory processing disorder in second grade students; Dor-
neles et al. (2014) used the test to evaluate the writing of
ADHD students; and Basso et al. (2017) used it to evaluate
the writing of adults with developmental dyslexia.
When applying the dictation, the evaluator described
the activity, following the test instructions (Moojen,
2011, p. 82). In the correction, one point was assigned to
every mistake made. Errors are classified into four types:
phonological, simple grammatical spelling, complex
grammatical spelling, and irregular phonological rela-
tion. The measures considered in the analysis were total
number of mistakes in dictation and spelling accuracy
obtained by the percentage of correct words. Students
with a percentile higher than 90 were excluded because

"they did not present alphabetic writing required for text
production.
A preliminary cognitive assessment was carried out to
exclude cases of intellectual deficit by applying Raven ’s
colored progressive matrices —special scale —to subjects
aged under 12 years (Angelini, Alves, Custódio, Duarte, &
Duarte, 1999) and general scale (Raven, 2003) to students
older than 12 years. In this study, results below the 50th
percentile on the special scale and below the 10th percent-
ile on the general scale were considered to have intelectual
déficit and were excluded from the sample to keep the
variable “intellectual level ”as homogeneous as possible.
All students with ADHD excluded from the sample were
directed toward an appropriate special service.
In order to diagnose ADHD and comorbidities, the psychi-
atrists conducted the clinical evaluation in accordance with
the DSM-IV criteria. The information was obtained from the
children ’s and adolescents ’parents through a semi-structured
interview (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophre-
nia for School-Aged Children —Epidemiologic Version [K-
SADS-PL]) applied individually. According to the diagnostic
criteria, ADHD was classified as combined, inattentive, or
hyperactive/impulsive. The psychologists applied the vocabu-
lary and cubes subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale —-
WISC-IV (Wechsler, 2013) indiv idually to evaluate IQ, and
an IQ below 80 was an exclusion criterion.
The teachers indicated 148 students by means of the
SNAP-IV, and after exclusions (Fig. 1), the sample was
composed of 47 subjects, who were randomized into two
groups (Table 1) by minimization, using the QMinim1soft-
ware. The following three factors were used: educational
level (correlated with age p< 0.001), IQ, and school
attended. In the stage of deferred post-tests, 3 months after
the end of the interventions, the sample consisted of 44
participants, because two subjects from the IG-WM and
one subject from the IG-Combined groups were transferred
to different schools.
Evaluation of expressive writing and WM: procedures,
instruments, and measures
The evaluation was performed three times: prior to the
interventions (T1), immediately after the end of inter-
ventions (T2), and 3 months after the end of interven-
tions (T3). The same instruments were used by external
evaluators at T1, T2, and T3. At the time of application,
the evaluators did not know the type of intervention in
which subjects participated, and at the time of correc-
tion of the tests, they also did not know which stage of
the evaluation the subjects were in (T1, T2, or T3).
The following instruments were used to assess WM:
–The backward digit span (Backward DS) subtest of the
Wechsler scales (Wechsler, 2013 ) consists of seven listso fd i g i t s ,s p o k e na ta ne v e np a c eb yt h ee v a l u a t o rt h a t
should be remembered in reverse order. This subtest
evaluates executive control over immediate retention of
verbal information.
–Backward spatial span (Backward SS): This test
evaluates how recent visuospatial information is
handled (Shiels Jr et al., 2008 ). It is a computer
adaptation of the Corsi Block-Tapping Task and of
the Spatial Span subtest integrated into WISC-IV
(Wechsler, 2013 ), which incorporates characteristics
of CANTAB ’s Spatial Span Task, provided by
Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh-PA (Shiels et
al.,2008 ). It is similar to the Digits Span Subtest in
the presentation of progressive sequences of
stimuli and by requiring responses in reverse order,
but it differs as to the stimuli, which are visuospatial.
–Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT): It is a
standardized test translated into Portuguese
(Malloy-Diniz, Fuentes, Abrantes, Lasmar, &
Salgado, 2010 ), used by Martins and Ortiz ( 2009 )
and Nobre et al. ( 2013 ) to evaluate phonological
loop and episodic buffer (Martins & Ortiz, 2009 ;
Nobre et al., 2013 ). It consists of a list of 15 words
(list A) read by the examiner at a 1-s interval. This
procedure is repeated five consecutive times and
each presentation is followed by the request of oral
enunciation of the words recalled by the participantTable 1 Sample characteristics

"(A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5). After completion of the
five tests, a second list of interference (list B) is read;
participants are asked to enunciate the words from
list B. Immediately after this distracting task,
individuals are asked to say the words they recall
from list A (A6). After 20 to 30 min, they are asked
again to enunciate the words from list A (A7). The
total score is determined by the number of words
correctly memorized at each attempt.
The following instruments were employed to evaluate
written expression:
–Balanced Dictation test (Moojen, 2011 ), applied in
the sample selection;
–Narrative Text Production Task (NTPT) —participants
were asked to focus their attention on a short story that
would be read. After reading the story, the evaluator read
the header contained in the task: “N o wi ti sy o u rt u r nt o
tell a story, by writing a narrative. You may continue
telling the story that has been read or create another
story with the theme ‘on the way to school ’.”It was made
clear that the time limit to complete the task was 30 min.
We provided no support material and no instruction on
the use of any strategy to plan or revise the text.
The texts were coded with random numbers and were
corrected by two external evaluators (an educational
psychologist and a teacher of Portuguese, both with
graduate degrees and extensive experience in elementary
school education), who were unaware of the objective of
this study, of the evaluation stage, and of the identity and
education level of participants. The evaluators participated
in a workshop on text correction for guidance on the cri-
teria and registration of the evaluation.
The level of textual articulation was used as a measure
of overall performance in text production, and the score
was attributed according to hierarchical categories 1 to
4, as proposed by Costa and Boruchovitchb (2009, p.
175–176). The different types of text indicators were se-
lected and grouped based on the processes of planning,
translation, and revision, as described in the Appendix,
according to the criteria employed by Miranda et al.
(2011).
Discrepant results among evaluators were analyzed by
the first author, who had the power to make the final
decision. The text was used for detection of probable er-
rors in the counting of quantitative variables, and the
mean score attributed by the two evaluators was used
for qualitative or counting variables with subjective
interference (narrative elements and level of textual
articulation). After some adjustments, we organized the
variables that originated from calculations of the values
of other variables.–Classroom Student Performance
Questionnaire (n.d): Small questionnaire developed
for this research, applied to teachers soon after the
end of the interventions, with the objective of
obtaining information about participants ’classroom
performance. It is composed of a scale of 10
items —four related to school performance and six
related to behavior. The teacher should check one
option for each item: little improvement, same as
before, significant improvement, and highly
significant improvement.
Intervention programs and procedures
During the evaluation and intervention processes, the use
of medication for ADHD was maintained, that is, the eight
participants who used medication continued using it with
no modification in its administration during the protocol
under the supervision of their physicians.2The remaining
students were not medicated.
Two intervention programs were used, whose choice and
organization took into account: (a) theoretical assumptions
and previous evidence, (b) possi ble adaptations to the Brazilian
population and to students with ADHD, (c) metacognitive
approach, (d) use of a mixed method for the development of
activities —partly developed individually and partly developed
collectively (use of computer and other resources), and (e)
application in the school environment.
The “Working Memory Program ”(WMP), developed by
the research group of Nunes (Nunes et al., 2014), at the
University of Oxford, was used for improving WM. The
WMP considers metacognitive skills as a means to develop
self-control over automatic attention and over the use of in-
formation testing strategies in order to improve WM
(Nunes et al., 2011). It involves the four WM components
proposed by Baddeley (2012), consisting of three online
games and five games with multimedia playback, each with
seven difficulty levels, available at http://www.education.ox.-
ac.uk/ndcs. The games involve explicit teaching and train-
ing of metacognitive strategies to recall information, which
increased progressively, and which, at times, needed to be
remembered in the order they were presented (direct order),
and, at other times, had to be recalled in the reverse order
in which they appeared (indirect order). In this study, we
used a version that was translated and adapted, upon per-
mission from the authors, for use with Brazilian students.
The program for intervention in text production was
developed with metacognitive strategies adapted from the
SRSD model (Mason, Harris, & Graham, 2011; Harris et al.,
2008), using the software Trabalhando com Habilidades de
Organização de Textos Harmônicos [Working with Har-
monic Text Organization Skills] —henceforth THOTH, and
Thoth also refers to the Egyptian god who invented writing.
The following features were included: THOTH softwarePisacco et al. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica  (2018) 31:5 Page 6 of 15",paper17.pdf,6
"with set of strategies for individual work, a file for multi-
media presentation with organization of guidelines for col-
lective activities in each session, and a notebook with a set
of guiding schemes and mnemonic codes. The interven-
tion included the gradual transfer of responsibility from
the mediator to the participants, both in each session and
in the process as a whole.
THOTH is based on the teaching of three types of facili-
tators for the development of simple explicit strategies
(memorization codes, guiding questions, and guiding
schemes) involving the proces ses of planning, translation,
and revision, which were translated into and adapted to
Portuguese. Narrative text was the chosen genre as it is
common to the different school grades and to the needs of
students, as shown by the analysis of the elementary school
curriculum and confirmed by the teachers of the participat-
ing schools.
IG-Combined and IG-WM interventions
The interventions occurred at the computer labs of the
schools and were mediated by two educational psycholo-
gists, the researcher and a research assistant. Groups of
four to eight students attended two to three weekly ses-
sions that lasted 40 to 50 min, totaling 23 sessions over a
period of approximately 3 months. In case of absence, the
student participated in the activities on another occasion.
Throughout the process, participants of both groups
received collective guidelines, worked individually and in
pairs, rehearsed and shared and discussed strategies.
The interventions were carried out in two stages (Fig. 1).
T h ef i r s ts t a g ew a st h es a m ef o rb o t hg r o u p s ,b e g i n n i n g
with the initial session and then 11 sessions on WM,
developed with the WMP. In the second stage, the IG-WM
still focused on WM while the IG-Combined focused on
text production, with the use of THOTH.
Data analysis
Agreement between evaluators was determined by the t
test for paired samples and by Pearson ’s correlation coef-
ficient for the variable “level of textual articulation ”by
the PABAK index.3The evaluators obtained similar eval-
uations for most variables. The lowest agreements were
for the categorical variable “level of textual articulation ”
(51.5% ( p< 0.001) and for four quantitative variables:
narrative elements (difference of −0.67; p< 0.001), plan-
ning errors (difference of −0.43; p< 0.05), presentation
errors (difference of −0.88; p< 0.05), and percentage of
revision (difference of 3.73; p< 0.001). Before proceeding
to the other analyses, the disagreements were adjusted
by calculating the mean between the values given by
evaluators to the categorical variable or by revising the
count of quantitative variables.
The comparison between groups and time (group ×
time interaction) was made by generalized estimatingequations (GEE). The normal distribution variables, tested
by Shapiro-Wilk normality test, were estimated using an
identity-link function. Variables with outcomes based on
counting were analyzed using a Poisson distribution with
log-link function. The proportion of the binary variable
was estimated using a binary distribution with logit. For
all models, we used an unstructured working correlation
matrix and a robust estimator covariance matrix. The post
hoc Bonferroni test was applied to significant factors. In
an unstructured covariance matrix, there are no con-
straints. Each variance and each covariance is estimated
uniquely from the data. This results in the best possible
model fit, because each variance and covariance value is
very close to what the data reflect.
Cohen ’s effect size was computed for comparisons of
the evaluation times of the groups, for the variables in
which significant differences were found, and for the
deltas of the evaluation times in the groups of the variable
“level of textual articulation ”. For the Classroom Student
Performance Questionnaire, the groups were compared
using the Mann-Whitney test as the questionnaire has
only one measure and showed an assymetric distribution.
We used the SPSS software, version 18, for the statistical
analyses. The significance level was set at 0.05.
Results
The results for written expression and WM are described
considering the performance of the two intervention
groups at the three time points for different measures,
determining the group × time interactions and the effect
size of interventions.
Table 2 also shows the significant results of writing pro-
cesses. In the planning process, intervention group and
time interaction was significant for narrative elements.
The results with significant differences related to the
translation process were as follows: group and time inter-
action was significant for words/clause (IG-WM was bet-
ter at T1) and paragraph (IG-WM was better at T1 and
IG-Combined improved at T2 and remained so at T3);
significant differences in time indicated that both groups
improved similarly after the intervention and that improve-
ments were not maintained for t ext length, morphosyntac-
tic errors, and presentation e rrors after 3 months. In the
revision process, statistically si gnificant differences were not
found in the revision of formal aspects (IG-Combined rose
from 11.6 to 20% and ended with 21.9, while IG-WM
started with 9.7%, increase d to 13.5%, and ended with
12.2%, with moderate effect size at T2 and T3) and time ×
group interaction was signific ant for content revision, and
in total revision —improvement of content was more sig-
nificant from T1 to T2 and it decreased between T2 and
T3 but it was maintained compared to T1, whereas for total
revision, both groups increased the percentage of revision,Pisacco et al. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica  (2018) 31:5 Page 7 of 15",paper17.pdf,7
"with the best performance obtained by IG-Combined, and
improvement was maintained at T3, as shown in Fig. 2.
The group that received the combined intervention
performed better in textual articulation, measure used to
assess the overall quality of text production, with highly
significant group × time interaction and large effect size
between groups at T2 and T3. Both groups improved,
but the results show significant differences in favor of
IG-Combined, as illustrated by Fig. 3
The mean level of textual articulation for IG-Combined
and IG-WM did not differ in the pretest and the greatest
difference occurred in the immediate post-test. The com-
putation of Cohen ’s effect size, with relation to time deltas,
resulted in a large effect size between the groups ( ΔT1-T2
(ES = 0.99) and of ΔT1-T3 (ES = 0.85)) and within the
groups (IG-Combined ΔT1-T3 = 1.00 and IG-WM ΔT1-
T3 = 0.19), indicating greater effect and greater mainten-
ance of quality for IG-Combined.
Other measures concerning writing were obtained by
employing the Balanced Dictation test. Significant differ-
ences in time indicated progressive reduction of errors
(T1 = 21.4, T2 = 17.8, and T3 = 16.0 for IG-Combined
and T1 = 22.3, T2 = 18.3, and T3 = 17.0 for IG-WM) and
an increase in spelling accuracy (64.75 to 69.08 and
73.22 for IG-Combined and 64.87 to 67.91 and 71.29%
for IG-WM) immediately after the interventions and
3 months thereafter.
Table 3 shows GEE results for WM and intensity of
symptoms with significant differences. Group × time
interaction in Backward SS showed better IG-WM per-
formance in the pretest. ADHD symptoms were measured
by SNAP-IV at T1 and T2, and group × time interaction
was significant for hyperactivity/impulsivity severity, with
reduction in IG-Combined.
There were no significant differences between the
groups (Mann-Whitney p> 0.05) for any of the items of
school performance and behavioral aspects reported by
teachers in the Classroom Student Performance Ques-
tionnaire. Considering the total sample, the percentage
of students who showed significant or very significant
improvement in performance was 55.3% in mathematics,
63.8% in writing, 47.8% in other subjects, and 61.7% in
reduction of errors in assessments and activities. As for
behavior in the classroom, considering the total number
of students in both groups, there was significant or very
significant improvement: 53.2% in organization, 51.1% in
meeting deadlines, 59.6% in persistence in performing
activities that require more cognitive effort, 54.3% in at-
tention to explanations and classroom activities, 42.6%
in agitated behavior, and 51.1% in compliance with rules.
Discussion and conclusions
An innovative intervention process was carried out
among students with ADHD with the aim of comparingtwo interventions using a metacognitive approach. While
both programs used self-regulation strategies, such as
self-control of attention and self-monitoring of behavior,
their focus differed —one intervention focused on work-
ing memory and writing and the other only on working
memory. Our central aim was to compare the effects of
the two interventions on specific text production skills
and different aspects of elementary school performance
of students with ADHD.
The results show group × time interaction at the level
of articulation and measures of writing processes, sug-
gesting better performance in the group receiving the
combined intervention. The planning process had sig-
nificant differences for denouement, a narrative element,
and the translation process was significant for words/
clause (IG-WM was better at T1) and paragraph (IG-
WM was better at T1 and IG-Combined improved at T2
and remained so at T3). Statistically significant differ-
ences were not found in the revision of formal aspects
(IG-Combined went from 11.6 to 20% and ended with
21.9, while IG-WM started with 9.7%, rose to 13.5%, and
ended with 12.2%), and time and group interaction was
significant for content revision and in total revision.
Content improvement was more significant from T1 to
T2; there was reduction from T2 to T3, but improve-
ment was maintained compared to T1 whereas the per-
centage of revision increased in both groups, with the
best performance observed in IG-Combined and im-
provement maintained at T3, as shown in Fig. 2.
Improvement in written textual articulation after inter-
vention with metacognitive strategies had been previ-
ously observed by Costa and Boruchovitch (2009) in a
study with Brazilian children with typical development.
Although no previous study has been conducted with
students with ADHD in Brazil, evidence of improved
text quality among students with the disorder after inter-
vention in the SRSD model was found in a study from
the USA (Reid et al., 2014). Similar to the results of the
present research, an increase in structural elements in
writing and in text length after interventions based on
the same model among students with ADHD was also
observed in the review by Reid et al. (2014). However, in
the aforementioned review of studies, no evaluation was
conducted on the maintenance of the effects for longer
periods, and the effects were not compared between dif-
ferent interventions. Great difficulty in the revision
process among students with ADHD was reported by
Rodriguez et al. (2009) and Miranda et al. (2011). While
those studies did not include an intervention, the difficul-
ties described by them may help us to explain why in the
present study, although combined intervention contrib-
uted to increasing revision, correction attempts continued
to be insufficient in relation to the total text errors after
the intervention.Pisacco et al. Psicologia: Reflexão e Crítica  (2018) 31:5 Page 8 of 15",paper17.pdf,8

"WM measurements did not show significant differences
between the two groups: WM and combined intervention.
The study by Nunes et al., 2014 found favorable results in
these WM measures in deaf children after the intervention,
with the same program used for both groups in the first
stage of intervention and in the second stage for IG-WM.
Improvement in WM measures in students with ADHD
after the intervention was found in studies that employed
other programs (Klingberg et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2012;
Gropper et al., 2014). However, when comparing the results
of this study with those cited above, the following must be
taken into consideration: unlike this study, the other studies
did not compare two groups that received WM interven-
tions and the evaluation was conducted with tasks similar
to those which were trained. Thus, the differences between
the results may be explained, in part, by methodological
differences; therefore, the difficulty of comparing the stud-
ies should be emphasized.
The severity of ADHD symptoms was investigated by
means of SNAP-IV before and immediately after the inter-
ventions, suggesting a significant reduction in the intensity
of hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms for IG-Combined.We can suppose that the reduction could be linked to the
improved inhibitory control developed as a consequence
of the writing training with metacognitive focus. School
performance and behavioral aspects reported by the Class-
room Student Performance Questionnaire showed im-
provement in behavioral symptoms (organization, meeting
deadlines, persistence in activ ities that require more cogni-
tive effort, attention in the classroom, agitated behavior,
and compliance with rules) and school performance (math-
ematics, writing and other subjects, reduction of errors in
assessments and activities) in about 50% ( N=f r o m1 1t o
17 depending on the category) of the participants of both
groups. Beneficial effects of computer programs for WM
training, such as reduction of symptoms caused by the dis-
order, were also found in oth er studies (Gropper et al.,
2014; Gray et al., 2012). Metacognitive interventions in
WM strategies and writing process strategies can improve
the writing of students with ADHD, which can be effective
in the major ADHD symptoms, as shown in the study by
Asli et al. (2014). In summary, the results suggest the com-
bined intervention improved some aspects of writing, with-
out compromising the improvement of WM, despite the
lesser intensity of specific training compared with the inter-
vention only in WM (12 vs. 23 sessions), and reduced the
severity of hyperactivity symptoms. The greatest improve-
ments were observed: (a) in the writer ’s skill of integrating
the basic elements of a narrative with the ideas intended to
be expressed in the text, as measured by the level of articu-
lation; (b) in the structure of the narrative text, described
by narrative elements; and (c) in improved paragraph struc-
ture and use of punctuation.
The results of this study must be considered within the
context of its limitations: the sample was selected from only
two public schools that may not be representative of the
Brazilian population of students with ADHD; no formal
evaluation of comorbidity w ith learning disorders wasFig. 2 Level of textual articulation for IG-Combined and IG-WM

"made; use of handwriting in the evaluation of texts, differ-
ently from the training conducted in the intervention,
which employed computer in the writing; collective evalu-
ation of writing may have interfered with text production
because of ADHD symptoms; no comparison with either a
non-intervention control group or an intervention focused
only on text production strategies. School grade and the
time the school teachers spent on writing narratives in daily
activities were not controlled , variables that must be taken
into account in future studies.
Despite the limitations, the contributions and implica-
tions of the study are noteworthy. The results show that
psychoeducation interventions carried out within the
school context may contribute to improving the writing
performance of students with ADHD. The evidence
obtained from teachers ’reports indicates transfer effects
from interventions in reducing the intensity of ADHD
symptoms, in improving school performance, and in
improving behavior in the classroom. Improvement in
writing and WM performance can also be considered a
transfer effect, since it results from distinct activities in
relation to those trained in the interventions. Finally, our
findings suggest that the combined intervention in textproduction and WM strategies was more effective in
improving the production of narrative texts by stu-
d e n t sw i t hA D H Dt h a na ni n t e r v e n t i o nf o c u s i n go n l y
on WM strategies. Given that access to special ser-
vices is limited for many children with ADHD, the
most important pratical educational implication of
this research is that it demonstrates the effectiveness
of conducting interventions that improve writing and
diminish the symptoms of ADHD in schools.

Abstract 
Background Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder which 
poses challenges for the individuals with the disorder and their families. While stimulant medications are effective, 
a comprehensive approach, including psychosocial and behavioral interventions, is recommended. There is a grow-
ing body of research exploring the potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions for children with ADHD. Our 
study aims to assess the effectiveness of mindfulness interventions in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and ado -
lescents through a systematic review of relevant studies.
Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, our systematic review searched PubMed, Cochrane library, Psycinfo, and Sco -
pus from January 2000 to August 2022. We included studies focusing on mindfulness for pediatric ADHD, comprising 
various study designs with a minimum 8-week duration. Descriptive statistics summarized results, while risk of bias 
was assessed using Cochrane RoB and ROBANS tools. The quality of RCTs was further evaluated using the Correlation 
of Quality Measures tool.
Results In the initial search, 450 records were identified, and after removing duplicates, 339 underwent screening. 
Forty-one studies underwent full text assessment for eligibility, with 11 studies meeting inclusion criteria, includ-
ing seven RCTs, two Quasi RCTs, and three cohort studies. These studies, conducted in five countries, involved par -
ticipants aged 7 to 18 years. Six studies showed improvement in hyperactivity/inattentive symptoms, and five studies 
showed improvement in impulsivity.
Conclusions This systematic review demonstrates the potential benefits of mindfulness programs on ADHD symp -
toms in children and adolescents. This study emphasizes the need for high-quality research to explore mindfulness-
based interventions for ADHD management in younger populations.

Introduction
Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a 
neurobiological disorder that is behaviorally defined [1]. 
It is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental dis -
orders and most widely researched field in children [2]. 
The ADHD worldwide pooled prevalence in children 
aged 18 and under is estimated at 5.29% [2]. The etiology 
of ADHD is complex, involving genetic and environmen -
tal risk factors [3], therefore, the assessment of ADHD is 
multimodal including fulfilling the DSM 5 diagnostic cri -
teria, identifying the risk factors and family history.
ADHD is characterized by persistent patterns of inat -
tention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity which can signifi -
cantly impact many aspects of behavior and performance 
and interfere with one’s daily functioning [4]. ADHD 
has significant societal and family burdens, particularly 
affecting parents [5]. Additionally, challenging behaviors 
exhibited by children diagnosed with ADHD can result 
in increased hostility and defiance directed towards their 
parents, subsequently contributing to elevated levels 
of parental stress [5]. To date, stimulants are the most 
effective psychopharmacological treatments available 
for ADHD [6]. However, it is recommended that drug 
treatment should always be part of a comprehensive 
plan that includes psychosocial and behavioral interven -
tions. ADHD is a complex disorder that varies in onset, 
severity, and response to treatment among diverse popu -
lations. This emphasizes on the need for considering psy -
chosocial interventions as tools for early intervention, 
hence the need for research on existing non-pharama -
cological solutions for ADHD management. There is an 
increasing evidence base to support the potential benefits 
of mindfulness-based interventions in the management 
of ADHD [7].
In a meta-analytic review of 472 adults, mindfulness 
training showed significant positive effects on ADHD 
symptoms [8]. However, two other reviews focusing on 
children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD revealed 
mixed results. One of the reviews was a meta-analysis of 
11 studies with 295 participants. It evaluated mindfulness 
effects on ADHD symptoms, internalizing and exter -
nalizing symptoms, and parental stress [1, 7]. The other 
review was a systematic review of 12 studies with 388 
participants, and it found limited evidence due to poor 
study quality.
To further understand the effect of mindfulness train -
ing among children and adolescents, our study aimed to 
analyze studies of adequate duration of the mindful inter -
vention. Furthermore, it aimed to assess other potential 
contributing factors that may influence the effect of the 
mindfulness intervention. For instance, ADHD subtype, 
presence of comorbidities, duration of the mindfulness intervention, providing training to parents, and presence 
of other treatment interventions.
Using a systematic review design, this study aims to 
focus on studies that assessed mindfulness as an inter -
vention to treat ADHD among patients under 19 years 
of age, with or without comparable control groups, to 
understand its effects on ADHD symptom-reduction in 
this population.
Methods
This systematic review was done following the PRISMA 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analyses) statement [9 ] and registered with 
PROSPERO (CRD42024520800; https:// www. crd. york.  
ac. uk/ PROSP ERO accessed 21 March 2024).
Search selection
We performed a systematic search using a search strategy 
in four different databases, including PubMed, Cochrane 
library, PsycINFO, and Scopus starting from Janu -
ary 2000 through August of 2022. We used a combina -
tion of keywords and medical subject headings (MESH) 
related to attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity 
OR “ ADHD” AND Mindfulness-based interventions OR 
MBT OR attention training OR mindfulness-based cog -
nitive therapy OR MBCT OR mindfulness-based inter -
ventions (Supplementary Table  S1 shows the search 
strategy for the study).
Six authors (M.A.S., F.A.N., B.A., E.K., S.S., and N.E.A.) 
were involved in the inclusion of studies. We used 
Rayyan software (https:// rayyan. ai/) to remove the dupli -
cates. Subsequently, the authors did the title and abstract 
screening followed by full-text screening with the same 
software. Only studies that satisfied our inclusion criteria 
were included finally. Conflicts in between two authors 
during the inclusion phase were solved through discus -
sion or later by an additional third author (J.J.) if consen -
sus was not reached.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to 
ensure the selection of studies relevant to the review 
objectives. Studies were included if they focused on 
children and adolescents under the age of 19 diagnosed 
with ADHD, as per standardized diagnostic criteria (e.g., 
DSM-5 or ICD-10). Eligible studies investigated mind -
fulness-based interventions, including but not limited to 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mind -
fulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), with a mini -
mum intervention duration of 8 weeks.
This duration is consistent with existing literature, 
where many studies have utilized 8-week interven -
tions, providing a robust framework for comparison 
and benchmarking results. An 8-week duration is also 
developmentally appropriate, as it allows for meaningful ",paper18.pdf,2

changes in children’s behavior and skills without causing 
fatigue or disengagement. Additionally, this timeframe is 
practically feasible, aligning well with school terms and 
extracurricular schedules, ensuring smooth integration 
into children’s routines. The core program is designed to 
be adaptable, allowing for adjustments based on individ -
ual needs and contexts, as detailed in the methodology 
section.
The interventions could be delivered individually or in 
groups, with or without parental involvement. Both ran -
domized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized 
studies (e.g., cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional 
designs) were included, provided they assessed ADHD 
symptoms or related outcomes such as sleep quality, 
anxiety, or executive functioning. Only studies pub -
lished in peer-reviewed journals from January 2000 to 
August 2022 were considered. Studies were excluded if 
they focused on individuals aged 19 and above, used case 
series or case report designs, involved animal models, or 
were published before 2000. Non-mindfulness interven -
tions and those lacking sufficient details on interven -
tion structure or duration were also excluded. To ensure 
methodological rigor, studies with significant methodo -
logical flaws, such as incomplete data reporting or lack of 
ADHD-specific outcomes, were excluded.
Data collection process
Six authors (M.A.S., F.A.N., B.A., E.K., S.S., and N.E.A.) 
were responsible for data extraction from all the included 
studies into a pre-piloted data extraction form in Micro -
soft Excel. A sixth author (J.J.) independently assessed 
the extraction data for validation. The data extraction 
process focused on obtaining comprehensive details 
about the included studies to ensure a robust analysis. 
General information such as the author, title, DOI, URL, 
and year of publication was recorded for all studies. Key 
study characteristics, including the study design, loca -
tion, study period, total number of children receiving 
mindfulness training, age range, mean age, and gender 
ratio, were extracted. Participant characteristics encom -
passed the method of ADHD diagnosis, ADHD subtypes, 
comorbidities, and details of the mindfulness training, 
including its duration, type, and setting (e.g., with or 
without parental involvement). The nature of the inter -
vention was documented to determine alignment with 
established protocols, such as Mindfulness-Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive 
Therapy (MBCT), as well as therapies that incorporated 
mindfulness principles but deviated from these standard 
frameworks. Outcomes of interest were primarily ADHD 
symptoms and sleep quality, along with secondary meas -
ures such as anxiety, depression symptoms, challenging 
behaviors, conduct problems, executive function, sleep quality, and parental stress. This structured approach 
ensured that the extracted data provided a nuanced 
understanding of the interventions and their contexts.
Synthesis of results
We employed descriptive statistics to derive various sum -
mary measures from the gathered data. Continuous data 
points were represented as either median with interquar -
tile range (IQR) or mean with standard deviation (+/- 
SD). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages, 
while outcomes were presented as counts and their cor -
responding percentages.
Study risk of bias assessment
Study quality was evaluated using the quality assessment 
tools. The Cochrane risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment tool 
version 1 was used for randomized trials [10] and for 
Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) included in this 
systematic review, and the Risk-of-bias Assessment Tool 
for Non-randomized Studies (ROBANS) [11] was used 
for non-randomized studies. These instruments were cre -
ated to evaluate the internal validity of a trial, the extent 
to which the reported effects can strictly be attributed to 
the intervention applied, and the potential flaws in meth -
odology or implementation.
Types of bias and the domains that are assessed by 
the RoB assessment tool version 1 included Selection 
(Sequence generation; Allocation concealment), Perfor -
mance (Blinding of participants and research personnel; 
Other potential threats to validity), Detection (Blind -
ing Of Outcome Assessments, Other Potential Threats 
To Validity), Attrition (Incomplete Outcome Data) and 
Reporting (Selective Outcome reporting).
Types of bias and the domains that are assessed by the 
ROBANS tool included several items to evaluate bias for 
non-randomized studies namely Selection Bias (selection 
of participants; confounding variables), Performance Bias 
(Measurement of exposure or intervention ), Detection 
Bias (blinding of outcome assessments), Attrition Bias 
(incomplete outcome data), and Reporting bias (selective 
outcome reporting).
Six independent investigators (M.A.S., F.A.N., B.A., 
E.K., S.S., and N.E.A.) utilized The RoB assessment tool 
to evaluate the methodological quality of RCTs Two 
authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each 
study included in this systematic review. A final third 
author (J.J.) decided on any disagreements which were 
discussed with all the authors, and the decision was made 
via a consensus. Non-randomized studies underwent 
methodological quality assessment in a similar fashion 
using the RoBANS tool.
Furthermore, the Correlation of Quality measures 
with estimates of treatment effects in meta-analyses of ",paper18.pdf,3
"Page 4 of 22 Sultan et al. BMC Pediatrics           (2025) 25:32 
randomized controlled trials tool [12] was employed to 
assess the quality of the included RCTs.
Results
Study selection
After identifying a total of 450 records from selected 
databases during the initial search, 111 were removed 
as duplicates and 339 were included to undergo title and 
abstract screening. Finally, forty-one were chosen for full 
text screening but only 11 met the inclusion criteria out 
of which seven were RCTs [13–19], two were of a Quasi 
RCT design [20, 21] and two were cohort studies [22, 23]. 
Figure  1 shows the PRISMA diagram for our study selec -
tion process.
Study characteristics
The included studies were conducted across 5 countries: 
including Canada, Italy, Netherlands, United States and 
Spain. Across the studies, the overall age of participants 
ranged from 7 to 18 years old. Seven studies included 
only children [14– 16, 19, 21–23], and four studies 
included both children and adolescents [13, 17, 18, 20]. 
Five studies [15, 17, 18, 20, 21] included the participa -
tion of parents. The sample size ranged from 5 to 55 par -
ticipants, with a total of 234 participating children and 
adolescents in all the included studies. In respect of the study design, seven studies were randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs), two cohort studies, and two pre/post 
design. The main characteristics of the included studies 
are summarized in Table  1 and the outcome measure -
ment tools used in studies are summarized in supple -
mentary table S2.
Mindfulness interventions
The majority of the MBT interventions used were based 
on the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction protocol 
(MBSR) and the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT), one study used Mindful Movement Treat -
ment, based largely in Tai Chi practice, and one used 
Mindfulness Martial Arts (MMA) which is described as 
a manualized group treatment program that incorporates 
elements of mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioral 
therapy (CBT), behavior modification and mixed martial 
arts. The predominant (10/11) intervention period was 8 
weeks, and one was 20 weeks long. The frequency of ses -
sions were mostly once per week, two studies had three 
sessions per week and one was twice per week. The dura -
tion of the sessions ranged from 30 min up to 90 min.
Effect of MBT interventions on ADHD
Each study tailored the scales used to assess the changes 
in ADHD symptoms based on their parameters of focus.

Huguet et  al. 2017 used the Conners parent rated scale 
(CPRS) to assess ADHD symptoms, SCARED scale to 
assess anxiety symptoms, Stroop color and ward cards 
and coding subtest WISC to assess cognitive flexibility, 
automatous response inhibition and attention capacity 
[23]. Digit span and arithmetic subsets of WISC- IV were 
used to measure working memory, and CPT-III was used 
for the four measurements of inattentiveness, sustained 
attention, and impulsivity [23]. Santonastaso et  al. 2020 
assessed impulsivity and restlessness using the CGI rest -
less-impulsive scale, and ADHD symptoms were meas -
ured using CPRS [16]. CPT-II, stroop color word test, 
MASC was used in assessing anxiety, CDI for depres -
sion and PSI-SF was used to assess parental stress [16]. 
Huguet et al. 2019 used CBCl, WISC-IV, ADHD Rating 
Scale ARS and SCQ [14]. In Clark et al. 2020 subsets of 
Conners 3 were used to assess inattention, hyperactiv -
ity, impulsivity, executive functions, ODD and emotional 
lability, and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity 
CGI-S was also used to assess ADHD symptom sever -
ity [22]. Muratori et  al. 2021 focused on the use of the 
Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire SDQ-Hyperac -
tivity subscale, Avoidance and fusion questionnaire for 
youth AFQ scores and the Child and Adolescent Mind -
fulness Measure CAMM scores [15]. Van der Oord et al. 
2012 utilized the Disruptive Behavior Disorder Rating 
scale, DBDRS, Parental Scale Index PSI, the ADHD Rat -
ing Scale ARS [21]. Van de Weijer-Bergsma et  al. 2012 
used the Youth Self Report YSR, CBCL, the Teacher 
report Form TRF, Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive 
Function BRIEF, PSI, Subjective Happiness scale SHS, 
Flinders Fatigue Scale FFS was also used to assess insom -
nia associated daytime fatigue [20]. Siebelink et al. 2022 
used BRIEF, CPRS, CTRA and the Strength and Weak -
nesses of ADHD symptom and Normal behavior SWAN 
scales [17]. Valero et  al. 2022 [18] used CPRS, PSI, and 
WISC-IV assessments [18]. Zaccari et  al. 2022 focused 
on the use of CBCL 6–18 to assess ADHD symptoms 
[19]. Haydicky et  al. 2012 used CBCL, BRIEF and YSR 
assessments [13].
Overall, the studies showed improvement in the hyper -
activity/ inattentive symptoms [15, 16, 19, 21–23] as well 
as reported decrease in oppositional defiant and conduct 
problems [13], impulsivity [16, 19, 21–23], improvement 
of executive function [18, 22], and self-control [14, 17].
A cohort study of 5 children diagnosed with ADHD 
revealed reductions in all core symptoms of ADHD 
(inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) according to 
the parents version of Conners Rating Scale (p = .04) 
[23]. Furthermore, this study revealed improvements in 
anxiety symptoms according to the SCARED scale. This 
was statistically significant for the scales completed by parents (p = .04), however, was not statistically significant 
for the scales completed by children (p = .68) [23].
Four RCTs [15, 16, 19, 21] showed a significant 
decrease in core ADHD symptoms. The RCTs also 
reported other significant measured outcomes. Santo -
nastaso et  al. 2020, reported a significant decrease in 
the CGI restless-impulsive scale and CGI total subscale 
and significant mean improvement in all neuropsycho -
logical measures and executive function deficits [16]. 
Zaccari et  al. 2022 showed improvement in sleep qual -
ity on parental questionnaires [19]. Muratori et al. 2021, 
reported an improvement in visual motor processing 
speed, visual perception and focused attention as well as 
a significant improvement in cognitive flexibility meas -
ured on the Bells Test - Accuracy score (p = .002) [15].
The four other RCTs [13, 14, 17, 18] showed no signifi -
cant difference in total ADHD symptoms but significant 
improvement in other outcomes; Siebelink et  al. 2022 
showed a trend of decreased hyperactivity/inattentive -
ness and restlessness/impulsivity symptoms and better 
self-control at post-treatment than those in the care-as-
usual (CAU) group, but not statistically significant (ITT: 
d = 0.27, p = .18; PP: d = 0.33, p = .11) [17]. Haydicky et al. 
2012, reported significant improvement in oppositional 
defiant problems and conduct problems [13]. Huguet 
et al. 2019, showed no significant difference in attention 
problems scale in the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) 
but improved emotion self-regulation in the Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (p = .032) [14]. Valero et  al. 
2022 [18]showed no significant difference in inattention 
and hyperactivity/impulsivity on the post-test, however, 
it did have a significant decrease in inattention symptoms 
(p = .0324) and executive functions (p = .02) on the parent 
rated Conners Rating scale during the 6 months follow 
up [18]. It also reported a significant decrease in parental 
stress (post test, p = .038) as well as a statistically signifi -
cant differences at follow up for externalizing problems 
on Conners (LD p = .013), aggression ( p = .045) and peer 
relations (p = .30) [18].
Two cohort studies [22, 23] showed significant reduc -
tion in hyperactivity/inattentive symptoms and impul -
sivity. Clark et  al. 2020, a cohort of 29 children showed 
decreased core symptoms according to the Conners 3 
subscales; Conners inattentive (p < .001), hyperactive/
impulsive (p = .01), executive function (p < .001), ODD 
(p = .001) [22]. Huguet et  al., 2017, a cohort study of 5 
children revealed reductions in all core symptoms of 
ADHD (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity) accord -
ing to the parents version of Conners Rating Scale 
(p = .04) [23]. Other significant measured outcomes 
include a reduction in anxiety symptoms according to 
the SCARED scale. This was statistically significant for 
the scales completed by parents (p = .04), however, was ",paper18.pdf,12
"Page 13 of 22
 Sultan et al. BMC Pediatrics           (2025) 25:32 
 
not statistically significant for the scales completed by 
children (p = .68) [23]. Furthermore the study reported 
significant improvements in measures that involve cogni -
tive flexibility, automatic response inhibition, attentional 
capacity (Stroop colour-word card) (p = .043) and pro -
cessing speed (coding subtest WISC and Stroop colour 
card), respectively (p = .043; p = .042) [23].
One pre/post design study [20] showed no significant 
decrease in ADHD symptoms, it also reported decreased 
parental stress in fathers but no significant improve -
ment in mothers. The study explored potential factors 
influencing the results, including the incorporation of 
parents, intervention duration, intervention type, and 
participants’ ADHD subtypes [20].
Regarding the involvement of parents, 5 out of the 11 
studies included them in the intervention [15, 17, 18, 20, 
21]. Among these, two studies Muratori et  al. 2021 and 
van der Oord et  al. 2012 demonstrated significant find -
ings, however, there was no observed significant differ -
ence in study results due to parent involvement [15, 21].
Examining the intervention duration aspect, seven out 
of eleven articles [14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23] implemented 
a once-per-week schedule, with three of them yield -
ing significant findings [15, 21, 23]. Haydicky et al. 2012 
adopted a 1.5-hour per session for 20 weeks approach 
but did not show a significant reduction [13]. Notably, all 
three studies employing a twice-per-week duration dem -
onstrated a significant reduction in ADHD [16, 18, 22]. 
However, due to the limited number of studies with this 
frequency, the significance of this factor cannot be con -
clusively determined.
Concerning the relationship between the type of 
intervention and outcomes, nine out of eleven articles 
employed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) 
and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)-
based Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) [14–21, 
23]. Among these, five articles demonstrated a signifi -
cant reduction in ADHD symptoms [15, 16, 19, 21, 23]. 
Tai Chi movement was utilized in a single study [22], 
resulting in a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms. 
In contrast, Haydicky et al. 2012 employed Mixed Mar -
tial Arts (MMA) during their study, with no significant 
impact observed on the outcome [13]. Due to the uneven 
distribution of studies across different interventions, no 
definitive comparative conclusion can be drawn regard -
ing the effectiveness of one type of intervention over 
others.
As far as the medications are concerned, out of the 6 
articles that showed significant difference in outcome, 2 
of them had participants on ADHD medications [21, 22]. 
Conversely, out of the five articles showing no significant 
difference in ADHD symptom domains, four included 
participants on ADHD medications [13, 17, 18, 20].When examining the connection between the ADHD 
subtypes and comorbidities on the outcome, it was noted 
that all studies incorporated participants, with the major -
ity having a combined ADHD type followed by the inat -
tentive type. Since there is no significant disparity in 
the ratio of ADHD subtypes across the studies, we are 
unable to identify any correlation with the available data. 
Regarding comorbidities, all studies included a majority 
of participants with various pre-existing disorders such 
as anxiety, emotional dysregulation, dyslexia, and Oppo -
sitional Defiant Disorder (ODD). Therefore, we cannot 
draw a conclusive correlation between comorbidities and 
the outcome.
Risk of bias and quality assessment in studies
The RoB assessment tool [9] used to assess risk of bias 
for randomized trials included in this systematic review 
indicated only one study [13] had an issue with random 
sequence generation and allocation concealment which 
may have led to selection bias. A high risk for perfor -
mance bias in terms of blinding of participants and 
research personnel was noted in two studies [15, 17]. Five 
out of the seven studies [13, 15, 17–19] had a high risk of 
detection bias due to issues in the blinding of outcome 
assessments. One study [19] had incomplete outcome 
data indicative of attrition bias. No study was found to 
have issues in reporting bias (Selective Outcome report -
ing) (See Figs. 2 and 3).
The ROBANS tool [11] used to evaluate risk of bias for 
non-randomized studies showed all four studies [20–23] 
had a risk for selection bias with problems noted sur -
rounding sequence generation and confounding varia -
bles. All four studies also had a high risk for performance 
bias in terms of the measurement of exposure or inter -
ventions. These studies also were found to be at risk for 
detection bias with issues in blinding of outcome assess -
ments. None of the studies had incomplete outcome data 
and therefore there are no issues in attrition bias. One 
study [23] was selective in outcome reporting and thus at 
high risk for reporting bias. (See Figs. 4 and 5).
Table  2 shows the assessment of quality of included 
RCTs in this review as measured by the Correlation of 
Quality measures with estimates of treatment effects in 
meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials tool [12].
Discussion
Our systematic review consisting of 11 studies with a 
total number of 234 patients, sheds light on the potential 
benefits of mindfulness programs on the core symptoms 
of ADHD. Six studies revealed overall improvement in

have recently garnered attention for the potential role 
they can play in improving the symptoms of ADHD. This 
proposed treatment modality is particularly appealing to 
a special population such as children and adolescents. It 
can probably contribute to additional benefits associated 
with psychostimulant medication treatment of ADHD.
Several characteristics of the mindfulness programs 
were noted to have an impact on outcomes, potentially 
yielding a greater effect size. For instance, the studies 
highlighting parental involvement tended to report larger 
effect sizes, suggesting a positive correlation [18, 21]. 
Similarly, more intensive interventions yielded greater 
reductions in ADHD symptoms, supporting the hypoth -
esis that these factors contribute significantly to the effi -
cacy of mindfulness programs [16, 19, 22]. However, it’s 
important to note that the limited number of studies 
impacts our ability to draw definitive conclusions, and 
further studies are needed to support these observed 
relations.
However, it is essential to critically evaluate the findings 
in light of existing literature. Moreover, recent evidence 
from the My Resilience in Adolescence (MYRIAD) Trial 
highlights the importance of considering adverse effects 
and subgroup differences in mindfulness interventions, 
particularly within school settings [24]. Prior system -
atic reviews have suggested small effects of school-based 
mindfulness training (SBMT) on mental health outcomes 
and well-being, but evidence is limited by small sample 
sizes, short follow-up periods, and heterogeneity in out -
comes and target populations [24].
Contrary to earlier findings, the MYRIAD Trial found 
no superiority of universal SBMT over standard social-
emotional education, raising questions about subgroup 
benefits and implementation factors [25]. Specifically, 
concerns have been raised regarding potential iatrogenic 
effects in individuals with mental health difficulties [25]. 
In line with these considerations, our review underscores 
the importance of exploring potential moderators and 
implementation factors of mindfulness interventions. 
Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understand -
ing the complexities surrounding ADHD treatment to 
provide comprehensive care.
Understanding the complexities surrounding ADHD 
treatment necessitates a comprehensive approach that 
integrates various modalities. While mindfulness inter -
ventions may offer supplementary benefits, it is essen -
tial to acknowledge the extensive evidence supporting 
pharmacological interventions, such as stimulant medi -
cations. There are few studies revealing potential toler -
ance to stimulant medications and authors of a literature 
review recommended more studies in this area [26]. 
However, a meta-analysis of 87 randomized controlled 
trials of medication treatment duration ranging from 3 to 28 weeks did not illustrate tolerance to medication treat -
ment [27]. In addition to evidence supporting medication 
management of ADHD, there is also extensive evidence 
supporting recommending various psychosocial inter -
ventions, including behavior management interventions, 
training interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy 
[28].
Furthermore, parental perceptions of ADHD pharma -
cotherapy is variable, with some parents expressing res -
ervations regarding the use of medications. This is due 
to multiple factors such as information seen in the lay 
press, concerns about substance dependence and doubts 
regarding the need for medication [8]. In view of such 
perceptions, MBIs can be a potential treatment modality 
clinicians may consider amongst the various treatment 
options available, particularly when discussing a suit -
able plan of care with parents who may have reservations 
regarding pharmacological treatment.
To discuss the possible benefits of MBIs in the treat -
ment of ADHD, we must first address factors that can 
influence the outcomes of these interventions. This 
research sheds light on a few such factors including inter -
vention type, intervention duration and frequency, par -
ticipants’ ADHD subtypes, concurrent medication use, 
and the involvement of parents and their supportive role.
As for the types of intervention used, the majority of 
the studies utilized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduc -
tion (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT). The benefits of mindfulness practices have 
been explored across different populations, ranging 
from patients with various chronic clinical conditions to 
healthy individuals seeking support in improving their 
daily coping skills. Overall, the data suggests that mind -
fulness training is a useful tool that improves coping abil -
ities, particularly in cases of distress and disability [29]. 
In our review of the available data, positive effects were 
observed in five out of nine studies, but the distribu -
tion of positive outcomes across different interventions 
was uneven. Some unique programs such as the Tai Chi 
movement showed promise, whereas Mixed Martial Arts 
(MMA) did not yield significant results [13, 22].
However, for such MBIs which were less represented in 
our study, more data is required with larger sample sizes 
before any clear conclusions can be drawn. Some stud -
ies have attempted to compare the efficacy of MBIs ver -
sus other treatment modalities such as comparing the 
effects of Computerized Progressive Attention Training 
(CPAT) vs. MBSR in adults with ADHD compared to a 
passive group [30]. Other studies have tried to compare 
the benefits of psychosocial treatment modalities ver -
sus medications, which found that while psychosocial 
treatments were helpful, they did not provide any addi -
tive benefit to stimulant medications [31]. While some ",paper18.pdf,14
"Page 15 of 22
 Sultan et al. BMC Pediatrics           (2025) 25:32 
 
studies have evaluated various MBI alongside each other 
[32], they have not attempted to make direct compari -
sons between the different types and to compare their 
degree of efficacy.
More heterogeneous studies with various MBI types 
that are equally represented would allow for more room 
to draw conclusions about the unique benefits of each intervention type, and comparisons in the efficacy of one 
type of intervention over another.
Intervention duration and frequency are other factors 
that must be addressed when reviewing the study results. 
All the studies included had a minimum of 8 weeks of 
intervention. A mindfulness program of adequate dura -
tion is likely crucial in order to ensure the benefits of the

intervention, for instance the effects of mindfulness on 
awareness and attention. The frequency of the interven -
tions varied across studies, with a range of once-per-week 
to twice-per-week schedules. Notably, all studies employ -
ing a twice-per-week duration reported significant reduc -
tions in ADHD symptoms [16, 19, 22]. However, due to 
the limited number of studies with this frequency, further 
research is needed to clearly determine the impact of 
intervention frequency on outcomes.
The distribution of ADHD subtypes and comorbidi -
ties across studies did not seem to have an association 
with intervention outcomes. The studies reviewed here 
include participants who had a combined ADHD sub -
type, and various comorbidities. Therefore, the impact of 
ADHD subtypes and comorbidities on the effectiveness 
of MBIs remains inconclusive based on the available data. 
Consistent with previous reports it is still unclear which 
ADHD subtypes would benefit more from MBIs [33].
The relationship between medication use and inter -
vention outcomes is an intriguing subject. Out of the 
six studies which reported significant impact of MBIs 
on ADHD symptomatology, only two included partici -
pants already receiving pharmacological treatment [21, 
22]. One explanation for this phenomenon could be that 
participants receiving medications have already displayed 
significant change from their baseline upon initiating 
medications, and therefore any further changes with 
adjunctive MBIs only displayed incremental differences 
in comparison as symptoms were already significantly 
improved prior to introducing MBIs. This observation 
was also noted in a different study where it was noted that 
psychosocial treatment modalities did not provide any 
additional benefits to patients who were already receiving 
methylphenidate medication [31]. Further investigation 
into the interplay between mindfulness interventions and 
ADHD medications is necessary to help formulate new 
approaches to management and treatment of ADHD.
Lastly, when discussing the role of MBIs in a younger 
population, we cannot overlook the importance of parental involvement and its influence on the efficacy of 
MBIs. While this may be less relevant in a more inde -
pendent adult population, children and adolescents are 
often shaped by the environments they are exposed to 
[34]. Family dynamics [35], adequate parental psychoe -
ducation [36] and parental involvement [37] are some 
points of interest when addressing this subject.
As for the findings in this review, two out of the five 
studies involving parents in the mindfulness training pro -
gram showed improvement in ADHD symptoms, Con -
sequently, the conclusions that can be drawn are limited 
[18, 21]. Across these studies, there were several reported 
benefits for both children with ADHD and their parents 
who underwent mindfulness treatments. For the children 
and adolescents, the studies reported improvement in 
hyperactive symptoms and inattentiveness [15, 17, 18], 
as well as executive functions [18]. As for parental out -
comes, different studies reported improvement across 
several domains such as improvement in parental hyper -
activity and inattentiveness symptoms, reactivity, paren -
tal stress levels and parenting styles.
It is difficult to judge fairly whether the reported 
improvements would remain consistent across the board 
as the different studies each assessed unique compo -
nents. The findings reported were not consistent across 
all studies as there were variances in the reported degree 
of benefit in each domain, with some studies reporting an 
absence of any significant improvement.
Comparing these results to existing studies in the lit -
erature which applied MBIs to other populations such as 
children with developmental delays [38] as well as those 
with normal development [39], there was overall a signif -
icant improvement in stress levels and greater life satis -
faction for the parents.
In a metanalytic systematic review of MBI for adults 
and children with ADHD, the pooled effect size of MBIs 
among adults was greater for inattention (g = −0.69, 95% 
CI = −1.13 to −0.25, p = .006) compared to their effect on 
hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms (g = −0.46, 95% CI

(g = −0.52, 95% CI = −0.96 to −0.09, p = .025) [40].
While our review provides insights into the potential 
benefits of MBIs for ADHD, further research is war -
ranted to address existing gaps in the literature, including 
subgroup differences, adverse effects, and implemen -
tation considerations. By critically evaluating the evi -
dence and addressing these challenges, we can better 
understand the role of MBIs in ADHD management and 
develop more effective interventions for individuals with 
ADHD.
Strengths and limitations
In terms of the strengths of this systematic review, the 
comprehensive search strategy resulted in the identifica -
tion and inclusion of a diverse range of studies, encom -
passing various mindfulness interventions and study 
designs. The inclusion of randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cohort studies enhanced the 
breadth of evidence and allowed for a more nuanced 
understanding of the potential benefits of mindfulness 
programs for ADHD.
Thoroughly analyzing study characteristics, includ -
ing participant age and parental involvement, offered 
a comprehensive view of diverse mindfulness program 
contexts. A detailed examination of intervention details, 
such as types, duration, and frequency, enhanced under -
standing of how these factors may impact outcomes.
The study’s emphasis on exploring potential contrib -
uting factors, including ADHD subtype, comorbidities, 
and the presence of other treatment interventions, dem -
onstrated a thorough investigation into the complexities 
surrounding mindfulness interventions for ADHD.
While the systematic review offered valuable insights, 
it is essential to acknowledge certain limitations inherent 
in the included studies. Notably, our review did not con -
duct a meta-analysis, and the small sample sizes across 
studies warrant cautious interpretation. A key limitation 
lies in the heterogeneity of the mindfulness interventions 
employed across the studies, with variations in protocols, 
duration, and frequency. This diversity made it challeng -
ing to draw definitive conclusions about the most effec -
tive mindfulness approach for ADHD.
The reliance on different scales and measures across 
studies to assess ADHD symptoms introduced variability 
in outcome assessment, potentially impacting the compa -
rability of results. Moreover, the risk of bias assessment 
revealed concerns, including issues related to blinding 
and potential selective outcome reporting, which may 
influence the validity of the findings. Additionally, the 
inclusion of participants on ADHD medications in some studies raises questions about the potential confounding 
effects of concurrent pharmacological treatments.
Although we utilized three of the largest research data -
bases that encompass educational research, a limitation 
of our review might be the absence of searches con -
ducted in other additional educational databases. How -
ever, leveraging these comprehensive databases may help 
mitigate this limitation to some extent.
Despite these limitations, this systematic review can 
provide a valuable source of information on the cur -
rent available evidence regarding the use of mindfulness 
programs as a potential treatment modality for children 
and adolescents with ADHD. It can also help shed light 
on existing gaps in knowledge that may prompt further 
research.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the com -
plex and multidimensional aspects of mindfulness-based 
interventions and how they can influence treatment out -
comes for children and adolescents with ADHD. While 
certain trends and hypotheses have emerged in relation 
to the positive impact of mindfulness on the core symp -
toms of ADHD, the presence of multiple factors influ -
encing study outcomes demands further exploration. 
Standardizing research protocols, for instance interven -
tion types, and outcome measures, as well as increasing 
the number of studies with diverse characteristics will 
allow us to gain a more comprehensive understanding of 
the potential benefits of mindfulness-based interventions 
for children and adolescents with ADHD. Such research 
is of utmost value as it has the potential to change the 
way we design treatment plans for patients, and it can 
guide us in designing more individualized plans of care 
fitting the unique needs of different patients.

Both adults and children –by the time they are 2–3 years old– have a general ability
to recode information to increase memory efﬁciency. This paper aims to evaluate the
ability of untrained children aged 6–10 years old to deploy such a recoding process in
immediatememory.Alargesampleof374childrenweregivenataskofimmediateserial
report based on SIMON/circleR, a classic memory game made of four colored buttons (red,
green, yellow, blue) requiring players to reproduce a sequence of colors within which
repetitions eventually occur. It was hypothesized that a primitive ability across all ages
(since theoretically already available in toddlers) to detect redundancies allows the span
to increase whenever information can be recoded on the ﬂy. The chunkable condition
prompted the formation of chunks based on the perceived structure of color repetition
withinto-be-recalledsequencesofcolors.Ourresultshowsasimilarlinearimprovement
ofmemoryspanwithageforbothchunkableandnon-chunkableconditions.Theamount
of information retained in immediate memory systematically increased for the groupable
sequences across all age groups, independently of the average age-group span that
was measured on sequences that contained fewer repetitions. This result shows that
chunking gives young children an equal beneﬁt as older children. We discuss the role of
recodingintheexpansionofcapacityinimmediatememoryandthepotentialroleofdata
compression in the formation of chunks in long-term memory.

A recoding process involves dividing an apparent arbitrary input into meaningful groups. The
ability to recode rapidly inputs made of identical constituents (000.111), regular series (123.321)
orknownmaterial(e.g.,25.12.1986,yourfavoriteChristmasyear)haslongbeenstudiedtoaccount
for the recall of information over short intervals ( Miller, 1956, 1958; Bower and Winzenz, 1969;
B
or and Owen, 2007; Farrell, 2012; Mathy and Feldman, 2012; Mathy and Varré, 2013). Although
t
his ability to chunk inputs has been thought to alleviate capacity limits in adults (Cowan, 2001;
C
owan et al., 2004), it does not constitute a full explanation of capacity increas es in immediate
memoryobservedinchildren(Gilchristetal.,2009),orage-relateddeclinesinimmediatememory
(Naveh-Benjamin et al., 2007; Gilchrist et al., 2008). It has been argued that capacity increases in
m
emory during child development were due to a growth in the number of items that can be held
independentlyofoneanother,nottoanincreaseinchunksize( Gilchristetal.,2009;Cowanetal.,

"Mathy et al. Span
Although chunking seems related to the deliberate
hierarchical reorganization of an input ( Ericsson et al., 1980;
Klahr et al., 1983; Servan-Schreiber and Anderson, 1990;
Perruchet and Vinter, 1998; Gobet et al., 2001; Rabinovich e t al.,
2014; Solway et al., 2014 ), another origin is a more perceptual
exploitation of statistical regularities in the environmen t
(Perruchet and Pacteau, 1990; Servan-Schreiber and Anderso n,
1990).Threetypesofregularitiescanbehighlighted.
Firstly, co-occurrences of events can be found in the input
stream. They can allow children to discover the words of a
language ( Saﬀran et al., 1996; Perruchet et al., 2014 ) without
relying on particular explicit strategies used for instance b y
adults becoming experts ( Chase and Simon, 1973a; Charness,
1979; Ericsson et al., 1980; Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995; Gob et
et al., 2001; Hu and Ericsson, 2012 ). Tracking the transitional
probabilitiesofaninputsuchas“bidakupadotigolabubidaku”f or
instance allows a child to incidentally segment the input str eam
into words. These newly formed words can be used to chunk
the previously encountered subsequences in a new input stream
presentingthesamestatisticalpatterns.
A second possibility for forming a chunk is to take proﬁt of a
unitization process that does not depend on the co-occurrence s
of subsequences, but which rather depends on the task at hand
(for instance, learning a particular sequence of motor actio ns
x−y−znomatteritsfrequency;see Perlmanetal.,2010;Minier
et al., 2015 ). In this case, the xyzchunk allows the participant to
speed up the motor actions, as when one retrieves the alphabet
(Klahretal.,1983 ).
A third way to form a chunk is to cluster together a set
of identical units of a sequence sometimes presented just onc e,
which has been referred to as a form of automatic or perceptual
chunking (clustering can be used for instance to train pigeon s
to learn lists more rapidly, Terrace, 1987 ; see also Gobet et al.,
2001).Someresearchsuggestthatinfantsareabletochunkobjec t
arrays when the objects are spatiotemporally grouped into two
setsoftwo( FeigensonandHalberda,2004 )andtoddlersareeven
abletoquicklyassignlabelstosuchnewlyformedchunks( Kibbe
and Feigenson, 2014 ). More diverse conditions were studied
byFeigenson and Halberda (2008) to show that perceptual,
conceptual, linguistic, or spatial cues are all suﬃciently eﬃ cient
to allow 14-month-old infants to store four-object arrays i n
memory. This literature suggests that an automatic process i s
available to children to recode information, which will serv e as
a working hypothesis in the present study to test if children
have a general ability to recode information to increase mem ory
eﬃciencyregardlessofage.Toextendthesepreviousstudies ,our
goal was also to examine how information in working memory
can be reorganized on the ﬂy using a recoding process that
can rely on external visual cues rather than internally store d
knowledge.
Becauseconceptualizationsofolderchildrenaremorerobus t,
we thought that reducing previously acquired knowledge woul d
be best for studying how limited-capacity memory can be
expanded by mentally organizing stimuli in working memory.
The present study therefore investigates how working memory
capacity is enhanced with the development of chunking abiliti es
using a novel approach based on an old game (SIMON/circleR).The original game consists of asking individuals to reproduc e a
sequence of colors that lights up by pressing four correspondi ng
colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue). The game starts with
lighting one color at random and progressively increases the
number of colors whenever the reproduction by the player is
correct.Gendle and Ransom (2006) reported a procedure for
measuring a working memory span using SIMON/circleR, and they
showedthattheprocedureisresistanttopracticeeﬀects.Previ ous
studies have shown that this setting has many advantages for
measuring the memory span of diﬀerent populations, including
those with speech or hearing pathologies ( Karpicke and Pisoni,
2004;GendleandRansom,2006 ).
In our version of SIMON/circleR, the chunks in the to-be-
remembered sequences were not generated by an artiﬁcial
grammar as in another study ( Karpicke and Pisoni, 2004 ).
Instead,weposedthatthechunkabilityofthesequencescould be
measuredbytheiralgorithmiccomplexity,anotionthatlink sthe
compressibility of a sequence to its simplicity. The algorith mic
complexity of a sequence is the length of the shortest algorith m
that is able to build the sequence ( Kolmogorov, 1965; Li and
Vitányi,1997 ).Incodingtheory,thegoalofanalgorithmusedfor
datacompressionistoattempttoﬁndanykindofregularityina n
input to encode, store and transmit information more eﬃcient ly
without any loss of data (i.e., the uncompressed data is ident ical
to the original data). From this perspective, a chunk can be see n
as a new representation obtained with an optimally compressed
code.Putsimply,asequencecanbecompressedwhenatleastone
chunkcanbeusedtorecodearegularsubsequenceintoasmall er
subsequence1.
When test circumstances allow a recoding process, the data
compression approach can prove successful to account for
how chunks can be formed rapidly without calling upon a
consolidationprocessinlong-termmemory. MathyandFeldman
(2012)have for instance shown that compressibility in to-be-
remembered sequences of digits was used by adult participants
for immediate serial report. Their model estimated that the
length of the compressed lists held in working memory was
approximately 3–4 chunks, which corresponds to the working
memorycapacitylimitsfoundbymanyotherinvestigatorsusin g
diverse protocols hindering a chunking process ( Cowan, 2001 ).
However, their estimation of the capacity limit was also in lin e
with theMiller’s (1956) 7±2 estimate because the 3–4 alleged
compressed subsequences corresponded to seven uncompressed
remembered items on average. Still, the more robust estimate
acrosstheirexperimentswasthenumberofcompressedlists(3 –
4), not the number of uncompressed items that instead varied
freely depending on the manipulated compressibility of the
sequences.

One basic idea is that a short algorithm such as “FOR
i=1:7, PRINT xxy” (or in somebody’s mind, a more
natural rule such as “7 ×xxy”) can account for the low
complexityof xxyxxyxxyxxyxxyxxyxxy .Incomparison,thestring
xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy might require a trivial algorithm such
as “PRINT xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy ” (i.e., the string itself, when
no regularity can be detected by the compression process). A
minimum description length approach (e.g., Rissanen, 1978;
Robinet et al., 2011 ) can be used to know whether the recoding
of the subsequence xxxinto a new symbol zcan allow a
greater compression of xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy . It could hardly
be the case for the present example because “ z=xxx, PRINT
xyzyxxyzyxyyzxy ” is globally not shorter than the original string
(since the rewriting process includes “ z=xxx”! But note
that better recoding is not excluded). Although such a recod ing
process is not excluded in humans, it is not practical to estima te
thecompressibilityofashortsequence.
One limitation of the minimum description length is that
it deeply relies on the arbitrary choice of a particular coding
language. A more neutral and objective approach particularly
suitable for the short sequences used in the present study (i. e.,
containing less than a dozen symbols) is to approximate the
algorithmic complexity by use of the coding theorem method
(Gauvrit et al., 2014, 2015; Dieguez et al., 2015 ). This method
is based on the fact that K(s)≈log2(m(s)), where K(s)
is the algorithmic complexity of the sequence s, andm(s) is
the probability that a randomly chosen deterministic algori thm
produces s. The method uses the fact that the compressibility
of a sequence is directly related to the probability that is
randomlygeneratedbyanunspeciﬁedmachine2.Unfortunately,
this approach involves that we cannot know what the optimal
compressedcodeisexactly.
To do so, we estimated the complexity of a set of random
sequences of four colors using the algorithmic complexity for
short strings (accs) R package ( Gauvrit et al., 2014 ), and we
split for each list length the simpler sequences from the more
complexsequencestoconstructthechunkablevs.non-chunka ble
experimental conditions. The non-chunkable sequences will
serve as a baseline for estimating participants’ storage capac ity
(forinstance,acapacitytoretainfouritemswouldbefoursl ots).
The chunkable sequences will serve for estimating participan ts’
storage capacity while chunking occurs (for instance, eight

structured complexity . This means that a string has high algorithmic complexity
whenitisrandomorshowsnoparticularregularityorstructure.Thus, algorithmic
complexity shall not be confused with other measures, such as Benne tt’s logical
depth, which is intended to capture structural complexity. For insta nce, the
decimals of πcan be produced by short algorithms such as the recursive
Leibniz formula, and thus have a low algorithmic complexity. Yet, the alg orithm
computing the πdecimals needs a long time to produce new decimals: so, the
series has a large Bennett’s logical depth. A direct comparison of algo rithmic

when controlling for the length of the string ( Soler-Toscano et al., 2013 ). (2)
Contrary to Bennett’s logical depth, algorithmic complexity is a direct measure of
how compressible a string is, and is therefore particularly relevant to our pre sent
study.(3)Unlike measures based on speciﬁc compression algorithms such as the
Lempel-Ziv method, algorithmic complexity makes no assumption about what
type of compression method is required, but nevertheless determines how much

Ourworkinghypothesiswasthatifthereisnochunkingacross

recalledseparatelyandthatthereisasimplegrowthofimmedi ate
memory capacity with age ( Pascual-Leone, 1970; Burtis, 1982;
Case et al., 1982 ). This is what we call the null scenario among
the following set of predictions. A second case was that if an
automatic chunking process is already available to infants a nd
toddlers ( Feigenson and Halberda, 2008 ) when a few redundant
information is prompted into the task, the span of children
across all ages for the chunkable sequences should increase in
an additive manner. For instance, if older children are able to
groupperceptuallytworegularitemsintoanewchunk,thesame
two items should be grouped by younger children, regardless o f
theirspan.Forinstance,fora blue−blue−red−greensequence,
the youngest children would automatically encode and corre ctly
recallblue−bluewith a span of one chunk (let’s hypothesize
a similar correct recall of blue−blueno matter its position
in the sequence). Older children would recall blue−blue−
redwith a span of two chunks, and the oldest would recall
the four items with a span of three chunks. Another example
is if the span increases from ﬁve to six in older children for
the non-chunkable and the chunkable sequences, respectivel y,
a group of younger children having a span of three for the
non-chunkable sequences should show the same increase of on e
item for the chunkable sequences, which would allow them to
reach a span of four on average. This prediction is based on the
possibilitythatcapturingaregularitydoesnotinvolveanys ortof
computationorreorganizationofthematerialtoﬁtcapacity. The
two automatically grouped items into a chunk would not reﬂect
an ability to reorganize information within each slot to mul tiply

A third case reﬂecting an absence of increase in chunking
would show a similar gain in information reorganization at
diﬀerent ages. For instance, if older children are able to
reorganize information to reach seven items for the chunkab le
sequencesinsteadofﬁveitemsforthenon-chunkablesequen ces,
they show a capacity to pack on average 7 /5=1.4 items per
chunk.Iftheyoungerchildrencanshowthesameabilitybase don
a smaller starting capacity of three items for the non-chunka ble
sequences, they should show a capacity of 3 ×1.4=4.2 items
for the chunkable sequences. This is a multiplicative scenari o
of capacity, but still this is an additive scenario on the log o f
capactity (i.e., because the multiplier eﬀect is constant, the lo g
of capacity shows an additive eﬀect). For instance, log2(4.2)−

log2(3)=0.49,aswellas log2(7)−log2(5)=0.49.Nointeraction
between age and the chunking factor should occur under this

Finally, if chunk size increases with age, the span for the
chunkable sequences should increase more than multiplicati vely
with the span. This prediction would involve that a true
reorganization process occurs within each of the available s lots

younger children having a span of three for the non-chunkable

chunkable sequences. This simply means that the respective tw o
groups (younger children, older children) would progressive ly

(respectively, one item per chunk and two items per chunk).

1. METHODS
Tostudyabilitiestoformchunksinimmediatememory,ourgo al
was to prompt a recoding process based on external cues rather
than one based on internal knowledge (to avoid contribution
from long-term memory). Children were administered a task
of immediate serial report inspired of the SIMON/circleR, a memory
game made of four colored buttons (red, green, yellow, blue)
requiringplayerstoreproduceasequenceofcolorswithinwhi ch
repetitionscouldoccurtoinducearecodingprocessontheﬂy.
1.1. Participants
A total of 374 healthy children were split into ﬁve age groups:
6-year-olds ( M=6.1 years, SD=0.20,n=54), 7-year-olds
(M=7.0 years, SD=0.26,n=70), 8-year-olds ( M=8.0 years,
SD=0.28,n=94), 9-year-olds ( M=8.9 years, SD=0.29,
n=92), and 10-year-olds ( M=9.9 years, SD =0.27,n=64),
from several public schools of the same county (note that most
schools in France are public). Most children were from middle-
class families. All of the children participated voluntarily , and
their parents signed an informed consent form. None of these
participantswerecolorblind.
1.2. Design
The one to-be-remembered sequence consisted of a series of
colored squares presented serially at the speed of 1000 ms per
color (Figure1). Each sequence started with a ﬁxation cross
centered on the screen for 1000 ms. Following the sequence,
a recall screen displayed four colored buttons on which the
participants were invited to click to recall the whole sequenc e
in the correct order. Contrary to the original game, the task
was nonspatial: each color item was presented in the center of
the screen one after another. The main reason for running a
nonspatial version of the task was that our method was not
developed to measure the complexity of spatial patterns in 2D.
Instead, it was developed to measure the regularity of a (1D)
stringofsymbols.Spatialpatternssuchas“fourcolorsclock wise,”
FIGURE 1 | Illustrative example of a sequence of three colors fo r the
span task adapted from the SIMON/circleRgame, followed by a response
screen in which the four colors were randomly placed on each of t he
four locations at each trial. The 1000-ms timing was in reality split between
a 400-ms presentation of the color followed by an inter-stim ulus interval of 600
ms during which a blank gray screen was displayed.
“two diagonals,” “top row, bottom row” would also probably
haveinterferedwiththeregularityinthesequencesofcolo rsthat
our metric captures. To further discourage spatial encoding, we
randomly assigned the colors in the response screen to the fou r
possible quadrants for each new trial. The colors were therefo re

pads were brieﬂy lit up with lighter colors during 300 ms, as if a
bulb was rapidly turned on. Clicking on the colors was paced by
this lighting of the pad (the children could not click on the next
colorwhilethecurrentpadwaslit).
Feedback(“perfect”or“notexactly”)wasdisplayedaccording
to the accuracy of the response after the participant validated
the response using the press bar. Feedback was given to tell the
participantwhethertheresponsewascorrectornot.Thisinsur ed
forinstancethattheparticipantswouldrememberthattheywer e

The participants were given two complexity conditions
(counterbalanced between participants). The Simple condition
prompted a chunking process, while the Complex condition
solicited less chunking opportunities. The sequences in each
conditionweretakenfromarandomdistributionofthousands of
sequences for which we computed their algorithmic complexity .
The sequences were then ranked according to their complexity ,
with the 100th percentile corresponding to the most complex
sequences. The sequences in the Chunkable (i.e., simple) and
Non-chunkable (i.e., complex) conditions were chosen at the
25th and the 75th percentile to constitute the two experimental
conditions. Sequences around the lowest percentile would

colors between the two conditions, and we thought that havin g
four colors in the chunkable condition would not allow enoug h

The procedure matched a standard memory span task (e.g.,
the working memory subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Sca le
for Children/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) in which t he
length of the to-be-remembered sequences progressively
increases, starting with length two. For each condition
(Chunkable and Non-chunkable), there were two diﬀerent
sequences per length but the task automatically stopped when
the participant was unable to correctly recall the two sequenc es
ofagivenlength.
Table1showsasampleofsequencesgiventoparticipants.The
two sequences of length two were identical in both condition s
(e.g.,blue−red, thengreen−yellow) in order to have the
participants use all of the colors at least once during the ﬁrst
two trials, as a warm-up. Noteworthy is that these four colors
are one-syllable words in French. Sequences of length three
only contained two diﬀerent colors in both conditions (e.g.,
green−yellow−yellowfor a chunkable simple sequence, and
blue−yellow−bluefor a less-chunkable complex sequence).
In both conditions, the sequences of length four and up never
contained more than three diﬀerent colors. One opposite pair
(simplevs.complex)wouldbe yellow−blue−yellow−blue−blue
vs.yellow−red−green−red−yellow. Theyellow−red−
green−red−yellowis one example of a complex sequence
that still contains a regularity since it is a palindrome. Howe ver,
recoding the sequence as a palindrome probably requires more
computation than simply grouping the contiguous identical

the palindrome is less noticeable when presented sequentiall y

2. RESULTS
First, we split the results according to task order (i.e., whe ther
the task was the ﬁrst one or the second one, regardless of the
manipulatedchunkingfactor).Therespectivespansfortheent ire
sample of participants were respectively 3.8 ( sd=1.1) for the
ﬁrst task and 3.9 ( sd=1.2) for the second task. The respective
spans using the highest span method were respectively 4.4 ( sd
=1.2) for the ﬁrst task and 4.4 ( sd=1.3) for the second task.
We observed no diﬀerence between the ﬁrst task and the second
task, for either of the span measures [ ts(373)<1.5,p>0.14].
Measures of the span using the all-or-nothing method or the
highest span method showed a high correlation ( r=0.93,
p<0.001,N=374; including when partialling out Age, r=
0.92,p<0.001,df=371), and regardless of task order (the
preceding statistics are given for the ﬁrst task, but the stat istical
resultswerestrictlyidenticalforthesecondtask).Given thehigh
correlation between our two span measures, we chose to rely
solely on the second measure (hereafter: Span) to conduct the
followinganalyses.

The individuals’ spans were submitted to a two-way analysis

Although the gain in the chunkable condition in Figure2 is

the 6-year-olds in the non-chunkable condition (3.1), 4.3 i n the
chunkable condition still represented a large increase of 39 %
(whichwassigniﬁcant,aswellasallotherincreasesobserv edat7,

Another way to approach the idea that chunk size did not
increase with age was to divide for each subject their respect ive

age groups. The average ratios showed that the number of items
that could be packedin the chunkable condition (in comparison

3. DISCUSSION
Although the maximum span length achieved at the electronic
game SIMON/circleRrevolves around seven in adults ( Gendle and
Ransom, 2006 ), which recalls Miller’s (1956) magical number,
these seven items or so that adults can recall probably do not
reﬂect seven separate chunks (see Cowan, 2005 , chapter 3).
Playing with the SIMON/circleRlooks like an ability to adapt to new
situationsinwhichonedoesnothavemuchexpertise,excepttha t

place exactly in such a game remains diﬃcult to approach, the
primary goal of the current study was to observe age diﬀerences

3.1. Immediate Memory Capacity
Development
If one wants to comprehend the growth of immediate memory
capacities across development, it is important to know exactly
what one is measuring through immediate memory tasks. As
emphasized by Cowan et al. (2015) , it is well-known that when
one tries to measure immediate memory capacities, various
factors can impact performance. Hence, a great deal of researc h
these last 40 years has been to identify the key factors that
determine immediate memory capacity. An important eﬀort
has been put into controlling some of these factors to verify
whether immediate memory capacity still grows with age
when these factors are neutralized, in particular the knowle dge
factor. Eﬀectively, chunking in general refers to the amount
of information that can be stored by meaningfully grouping
information. Case et al. (1982) famously showed that if one
controls the familiarity of the items (which operationalize s
knowledge),nodevelopmentaldiﬀerencesinimmediatememory
appearinawordspanwhencomparingadultstochildren(here6
year-olds). However, since then, results have more often sho wn
that immediate memory development is not entirely due to
knowledge, and Case himself proposed another interpretation
of his own results (for this rebuttal see Case, 1995 ). The same
year,Burtis (1982) observed that when chunking strategies were
controlled using matrices of letters, there was still a growt h of
immediate memory capacity with age. Cowan and colleagues
in several other studies ( Cowan et al., 2010b, 2011, 2015 ) have
systematicallycontrolledvariouselementsthatcouldexpla inthe
growth of immediate memory capacities. Cowan et al. (2010b)
showed that even when one controls the ability to exclude less -
relevant items, age diﬀerences in terms of immediate memory
remain. Similarly when encoding diﬀerences are neutralized ,
immediate memory diﬀerences still exist between age groups
(Cowan et al., 2011 ). More recently, Cowan et al. (2015)
controlled familiarity, which enabled to manipulate the size of
chunks through the use of knowledge. They used visual arrays

of English letters vs. unfamiliar characters with a probe ite m
recognition paradigm. Even with unfamiliar characters, tha t is,
when the contribution of knowledge was minimal and therefor e
when chunking was minimal, there still was an increase of
immediate memory capacities from ﬁrst grade (7 years-old) to
seventhgrade(12years-old).Thisincreasewascomparablet othe
oneobservedwithEnglishletters.Asresumptivelyputby Cowan
et al. (2015) , whatever type of control is adopted, immediate
memoryseemstoalwaysincreasewithage.
Our study controlled the strategic factor by reducing
the possibility to form chunks (in the condition for which
compressibility was minimal). In contrast to previous studie s,
we believe that our task better reduces the role of acquired
knowledge. Our results are identical to those of Cowan and
colleagues: when we reduced potential chunking strategies,
we still observe an increase in span with age. However, it
must be noted that our manipulation draws on a diﬀerent
kind of chunking. According to Gobet et al. (2001) , chunking
can be dichotomized into two categories depending on when
chunking occurs. The ﬁrst category assumes a goal-oriented
chunking (e.g., Miller, 1956 ), thought to be deliberate, where
conscious strategies can play an important role. The second
is perceptual chunking (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973a ), which
is putatively more automatic and implicit, and which can be
primitive ( Feigenson and Halberda, 2008 ). As presented in the
introduction, we believe that the repetition of colors enabl es
the participants to heavily rely on such perceptual chunking by
exploiting the statistical regularities of the repeated colo rs, but
strategic factors can also be developed consciously. In the ca se
of letters, the recoding possibilities seem more goal-orien ted.
Even if neither of the two types of chunking –in our works
or inCowan et al.’s (2015) – are entirely perceptual or goal-
oriented, we believe that our task draws more on perceptual
chunking than Cowan et al.’s (2015) . Hence for the ﬁrst time,
our results show that even when one controls for perceptual
chunking (which is reduced in our complex condition, thus
allowing minimal rapid re-encoding of information on the ﬂy) ,
there still is an increase of immediate memory capacity with
age. Our ﬁndings adds one more controlled factor to account
for the growth of immediate memory capacity, after knowledge
diﬀerences, encoding diﬀerences, and resistance to interfer ence
diﬀerences. One conclusion is that our observation that ther e is
aprogressiveincreaseofcapacitywithageinournon-chunkab le
condition makes clear that the capacity to rapidly form chunks
on-line does not solely account for the growth of immediate
memory capacity. Something else is at stake to support the
growth of the memory span. Conversely, our observation that
there is not a greater progressive increase of capacity with ag e
in the chunkable condition –than in the chunkable condition –
means that chunk size cannot easily be increased by direct
manipulation of information in immediate memory by children
less than 10 years old. Chunks formed in long-term memory are
probably a unique result of a consolidation process and childr en
are probably better oﬀ using knowledge (i.e., chunks previous ly
formed) to increase capacity than trying to re-organize the n ew
incominginformationontheﬂy.3.2. Number of Chunks Increases with
Development but not Size
Our originality was also to use a similar material (i.e., simpl e
sequences of colors) for the chunkable vs non-chunkable
conditions (whereas Cowan et al., 2015 , for instance compared
the span for chunkable letters against non-chunkable unfami liar
characters).Themainresultofthecurrentstudyisthatwef ound

and expertise (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973b; Gobet and Simon,
1996a,b;Guidaetal.,2012 ).Forchildren,thestoryisdiﬀerentand
more complicated. Some studies, like ours, shows that with age ,
thenumberofchunksincreaseswhiletheirsizeremainstable .For
example, Gilchrist et al. (2009) investigated the development of
working memory and chunks by manipulating the number, the
size and the meaning of sentences. The size of the chunks was
operationalized by the proportion of each sentence recalled, a nd
thenumberofsentencesrecalled,enablingtheauthorstota pthe
numberofadoptedchunks.Theauthorsobservedthatthechunk
size was stable from the ﬁrst group (7-years-olds) to the las t one
(youngadults),whilethenumberofchunksorslotsinimmedi ate
memory increased. Interestingly, even if our operationaliz ation
ofthesizeandnumberofchunksisatoddswiththatof Gilchrist
et al. (2009) , we found exactly the same results. The average
ratio we calculated showed that the number of items that could
be packed in the chunkable condition in comparison to the
non-chunkable condition was stable across the diﬀerent grou ps.
The knowledge that children obviously accumulate in long-t erm
memory does not seem to transfer to re-encoding information
on the ﬂy to form new associations, which stays stable in our
study, and might be primitive. Using the repeated colors, chun k
size could not depend on the participant’s knowledge much.
Instead, we show that encoding regular sequences is a primiti ve
process in children (see for instance our analysis on how the
pairs of colors were encoded equally well when the items were
repeated, regardless of age), and we believe this process can pla y
animportantroleintheformationofchunksinthelong-term.
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 201",paper19.pdf,8
"Mathy et al. Span
Even if our results conceptually replicate those of Gilchrist
et al. (2009) , opposite results do exist. Ottem et al. (2007)
for example found that immediate memory span development
reﬂects an increase in the size of each chunk rather than an
increase of the number of chunks. This conclusion was drawn
from three studies with participants’ age ranging from 3 to 16
years-old. When the correlation between immediate memory
span and language abilities was taken into consideration, no
evidence of a relation between immediate memory span and age
wasobserved.Interestingly,thisisalsowhatJonesandcoll eagues
(Jones et al., 2008, 2014 ) found using CLASSIC and EPAM-

repetitionwasindependentofworkingmemorysize.Thecrucia l
factortoaccountforthedatawaslong-termmemoryknowledg e,
and this showed that the size of working memory increases
thankstotheincreaseofchunkssize,notthenumberofchunk s.
Also relating to language abilities, Hulme et al. (1984) showed
a linear relationship between speech rate and memory span in
both children and adults, supporting the idea that increase of
speech rate with age could account solely for the development
of the memory span (i.e., a greater number of sounds can be
contained in a two second period with faster articulation). T his
account is not incompatible with a growth of memory capacity.
This results could eﬀectively be reinterpreted as the idea tha t
greater speech rate can increase what can be encoded within
chunks. Regarding our study, if so, a greater speech ability wi th
age should have facilitated the articulation of several repe ated
colors instead of switching colors. Such a process would have
favored the chunkable sequences, but such an eﬀect was not
observed.
3.3. Limitation and the Way Forward
One limitation of the present study is that the modeling of
compressibility is unable so far to determine the exact numbe rofadoptedchunkswithage.Althoughthecompressibilitymetr ic
is useful to apprehend the compressibility of a whole sequence,
it does not compute the number of actual chunks within a
sequence. Computing the exact number of separate chunks that
allowanoptimalrecodingofashortsequenceisalineofresea rch
for the future. In the present study, analysis of the response
times (to detect chunk boundaries) would be untestable since
the repetition of colors necessarily involved quicker clicks of the
mouse. One further line of experiments would be for instance
to systematically vary the location of the colored pads after each
click, to better understand the actual internal processes in volved
informingchunks(see Gilchrist,2015 ,forothermethodssuchas
addingneurophysiologicalmeasurestochunkingresearch,w hich
could be combined with models of compressibility to determin e
better the processes involved in the formation of chunks). Su ch
experiments would be a more sophisticated way to predict how
manyitemscanbecombinedtoformnewchunkson-line.

ABSTRACT
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental
disorder associated with suboptimal outcomes throughout the life-span. Extant work suggeststhat ADHD-related deficits in task performance may be magnified under high cognitive load
and minimized under high perceptual load, but these effects have yet to be systematically
examined, and the neural mechanisms that undergird these effects are as yet unknown.Herein, we report results from three experiments investigating how performance in ADHD is
modulated by cognitive load and perceptual load during a naturalistic task. Results indicate
that cognitive load and perceptual load influence task performance, reaction time variability(RTV), and brain network topology in an ADHD-specific fashion. Increasing cognitive loadresulted in reduced performance, greater RTV, and reduced brain network efficiency in
individuals with ADHD relative to those without. In contrast, increased perceptual load led to
relatively greater performance, reduced RTV, and greater brain network efficiency in ADHD.These results provide converging evidence that brain network efficiency and intraindividual
variability in ADHD are modulated by both cognitive and perceptual load during naturalistic
task performance.
AUTHOR SUMMARY
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects more than 500 million adultsworldwide ( Song et al., 2021 ), and confers suboptimal outcomes in many areas of life.
Emerging evidence suggests that ADHD-related cognitive deficits may be at least somewhat
task-dependent, with some work showing that increased cognitive load results in reduced
performance in ADHD relative to non-ADHD individuals, and other work showing thatincreased perceptual load may narrow, or even eliminate these deficits. However, these effects
have yet to be examined together, and their neural underpinnings are unknown. In three
experiments (one in the lab, one online, and one fMRI), we show that cognitive load worsenscognitive performance, and reduces brain network efficiency in ADHD relative to non-ADHD
individuals, while perceptual load has largely the opposite effect.an open access journal

"INTRODUCTION
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD ) is a highly prevalent cognitive processing dis-
order that confers suboptimal outcomes in many areas of life, including reduced educational
and vocational achievement ( Biederman et al., 2004 ), higher rates of drug and alcohol abuse
(Biederman et al., 1998 ), lower self-esteem ( Harpin et al., 2016 ), and diminished overall well-
being ( Danckaerts et al., 2010 ). One of the most stable and universal features of the ADHD
phenotype is high intraindividual variability in behavior ( Kofler et al., 2013 ;Tamm et al.,
2012 ). Individuals with ADHD frequently exhibit large fluctuations in reaction time and accu-
racy during task performance ( Kofler et al., 2013 ;Tamm et al., 2012 ). These fluctuations are
theorized to result from reduced information processing efficiency in the ADHD brain ( Russell
et al., 2006 ). Supporting this hypothesis, recent evidence shows that elevated reaction time
variability (RTV) is associated with less efficient connectivity patterns in the brain ( Machida
et al., 2019 ), and that those with ADHD exhibit reduced brain network efficiency both at rest
and during cognitive tasks ( Konrad & Eickhoff, 2010 ).
There is mounting evidence that clinically relevant individual differences can be modulated
by carefully chosen task parameters, enabling researchers to design tasks that maximize (orminimize) these differences to highlight specific cognitive and neural processes implicatedin mental disorders ( Finn et al., 2017 ,2020 ). Comparatively naturalistic (e.g., smoothly evolv-
ing in time and perceptually engaging) tasks such as movies and video games have proven
especially useful in this endeavor, serving to constrain undesirable confounds (like headmotion and mind wandering) while generating rich, time-locked neural activity patterns not
observable in trial-based neuroimaging paradigms ( Vanderwal et al., 2017 ). These efforts have
increased understanding of a number of mental disorders, including autism ( Bolton et al.,
2018 ), paranoia ( Finn et al., 2018 ), and depression ( Guo et al., 2015 ).
In the present study, we use a custom-developed and validated video game task
1(Huskey
et al., 2018 ) to investigate cognitive control perfo rmance and brain network efficiency in
ADHD across three experiments (one in a computer lab, one online, and one fMRI). The task ’s
primary goal consisted of collecting objects (crystals) while dodging asteroids. Participants
completed three variants of the video game task, one with increased cognitive load , one with
increased perceptual load, and one containing neither the cognitive nor the perceptual load
manipulations. Extant work suggests that cognitive load and perceptual load may differentially
impact task performance in ADHD. Cognitive load has been shown to magnify ADHD-relatedperformance deficits, leading to compara tively worse performance in those with ADHD
(Roberts et al., 2012 ). In contrast, perceptual load has been shown to minimize, or even elim-
inate, performance gaps between those with and without ADHD ( Forster et al., 2014 ;Forster &
Lavie, 2007 ). As such, we expected that increasing cognitive load would have a dispropor-
tionately negative influence on task performance and brain network efficiency in ADHD, and
that increasing perceptual load would have the opposite effect, reducing the gap between
ADHD and non-ADHD groups in both performance and brain network efficiency.

"we used Asteroid Impact , an open-source video game task.2In the first two experiments, par-
ticipants played Asteroid Impact in a lab environment, and in the third, participants played a
browser-based version on their persona l computer at home. The primary goal in Asteroid
Impact is to navigate a spaceship around the screen with the mouse, collecting valuable crys-
tals while avoiding asteroids (see Figure 1 ). Previous work has shown that cognitive resource
availability tends to be high during boredom (ability >> difficulty) and frustration (ability <<difficulty), and low whenever difficulty and ability are approximately matched ( Harris et al.,
2017 ;Huskey et al., 2018 ). As such, we designed the game to adapt its difficulty level (the
speed, quantity, and size of asteroids) to player performance over time, ensuring that all par-ticipants are challenged at a level that meets (but does not exceed) their abilities. Asteroid
Impact has been previously shown to be motivating and engaging, and to be usable within
both a behavioral and fMRI setting ( Huskey et al., 2018 ).
In each of the three experiments, participants played three different variations of the game:
a baseline condition, a cognitive load condition, and a perceptual load condition. These con-
ditions were identical across the three experiments. Participants also completed a speededreaction time task during gameplay, in which they were asked to press the “X”key on a key-
board when they saw a blue square appear on screen, and to press “Y”when they saw a pur-
ple triangle. This task was designed to index the speed and variability in participants ’response
times during each condition. In each experiment, the speeded reaction time task was rewardedin-game points. The triangle was worth 10 points, and the square was worth 1,000 points. In
all experiments reported herein, we only consider reaction time data from the low-reward
probes, as reward is known to modulate both the speed and variability of response times inADHD ( Tamm et al., 2012 ).Asteroid Impact:

Figure 1. Schematic of Asteroid Impact gameplay. The primary goal of the game is to navigate a “spaceship ”(A) around the screen to collect
as many crystals (B) as possible before time runs out, while concurrently avoiding asteroids (C) and responding to intermittent speeded reactiontime probes (D). Asteroid Impact adapts to the skill level of the player by increasing the quantity, size, and speed of asteroids, ensuring that allparticipants play at a difficulty level that is approximately equal to their skill. This serves to minimize differences in performance betweenplayers as a result of skill.

"Manipulating cognitive load. Cognitive load was introduced into the game using a variant of an
n-back rule maintenance task. The n-back is a widely used experimental paradigm in the fields
of neuroscience and cognitive psychology in w hich individuals must perform a particular
action —typically pressing a button —whenever a given stimulus m atches a stimulus that
occurred a certain number of trials in the past ( Owen et al., 2005 ). This manipulation has been
shown to elicit activation in working memory related brain regions and to be perceived ascognitively difficult ( Eriksson et al., 2015 ). In the version of the n-back tasks employed in this
study, an instruction screen informed participants that “some of the crystals are sabotaged ”and
that collecting two crystals of the same color in a row would result in a loss of 1,000 in-gamepoints. This required participants to maintain the identity of the most recently collected crystal
in working memory while collecting the next crystal.
Manipulating perceptual load. The study of perceptual load has a rather long and contentious
history within visual perception and cognitive neuroscience research ( Fitousi & Wenger,
2011 ), but a recurring finding is that increased perceptual load can improve performance in
visual perception and cognitive control tasks in people with ADHD (see, e.g., Forster et al.,
2014 ). Perceptual load has been manipulated in several ways, including increasing the num-
ber of items that need to be identified at any given time, increasing the difficulty of item iden-tification (through blurring, distortion, rotation, etc.), increasing auditory or visual background
noise, and reducing contrast betw een the foreground and the background ( Elliott &
Giesbrecht, 2010 ). In this study, we manipulated perceptual load by adding an overlay to
the gameplay environment that reduced the opacity of foreground elements (asteroids and
crystals) by 75% relative to the background.
Measuring performance. As the primary goal in Asteroid Impact is to collect crystals while
avoiding asteroids, we measured in-game performance as the number of crystals collectedwithin a 30-second window divided by one plus the number of asteroid collisions within
the same window.
3Mean performance did not significantly vary between Experiment 1 and
Experiment 3 ( MS1= 30.4, MS3= 31.2), but was lower in Experiment 2 ( MS2= 18.61), perhaps
due to the unfamiliarity of the controls used in the fMRI experiment. RTV was measured by
fitting an ex-Gaussian distribution to each participant ’s reaction times within each round and
taking the standard deviation of reaction times falling within the exponential portion of thedistribution. Overall RTV was higher in Experiment 3 ( M= 1,241.96) than in Experiment 1
(M= 962.26) or Experiment 2 ( M= 987.92), likely due to the online (i.e., less controlled)
nature of the experiment environment.
Experiment 1
Participants. Participants in Experiment 1 were recruited from the participant pool of the Com-
munication Department at a large university in the western United States. All participants pro-vided written informed consent and earned course credit for their participation. In total, 230
participants completed the experiment (159 female, 69 male, 2 chose not to answer, M
age=
19.58). Two participants reported having taken medication for ADHD within the 12-hourperiod before their session, and as such were excluded from the analyses reported herein.

"reiterating the goal of the game along with its controls. After this, participants put on head-
phones to minimize distraction, and began playing the game. Participants completed seven
rounds of gameplay in total —a practice round and two rounds in each condition. All rounds
following the practice round were presented in randomized order. After all levels were com-
pleted, participants completed the questionnaire items and were dismissed and thanked for
their participation.
ADHD symptom severity was determined using the full version of the Adult ADHD Self-
Report Scale (ASRS; Kessler et al., 2005 ). The ASRS has been shown to have 97.9% total
classification accuracy (sensitivity 68.7%) for clinicians ’ADHD diagnosis, a κof .76, and a
Chronbach ’s⍺in between .63 and .72 in the general population of the United States ( Kessler
et al., 2007 ). ASRS scores range from 1 to 4. Participants who scored 3.2 or greater (1 standard
deviation above the mean) were considered as high symptom severity ( N= 54), and those who
scored 2.0 or lower (1 standard deviation below the mean) were considered as low symptomseverity ( N= 48). In addition to the ASRS, participants completed a series of self-report ques-
tionnaires and provided basic demographic data. Data from these additional questionnaires
are not reported herein.
Analyses. All analyses in Experiment 1 were conducted in R ( R Core Team, 2013 ). Before
analysis, data were minimally preprocessed, removing RTs that were greater than 5 standarddeviations away from the mean within subjects and conditions. All main effects were testedusing linear mixed-effects models using the lmer() function from the lme4 package in R ( Bates
et al., 2015 ). Cognitive load, perceptual load, and ADHD symptom severity were treated as
fixed effects, and were coded using effects coding. Random intercepts were included for eachparticipant. All reported betas are standardized. Correction for multiple comparisons was con-
ducted using the Tukey method. As an additional check, we also conducted these analyses in
a manner treating ASRS scores as a continuous variable rather than binning participants andonly retaining high and low-ADHD groups. These analyses can be found in Supporting Infor-
mation Figure S2 .
Results. Results from Experiment 1 indicate that cognitive and perceptual load impact behav-
ioral variability and task performance in a manner contingent on ADHD symptoms (see
Figure 2 ). Under high perceptual load, the group with high levels of ADHD symptoms had
lower RTV —an indicator of fewer attentional lapses during game play —than did the
low-ADHD group ( Mhi= 709.99, SD= 432.03 Mlo= 735.64, SD= 518.99), and the interac-
tion between ADHD status and load condition on RTV was statistically significant ( F(1, 226) =

"6.97, p= .009). Those with high-ADHD symptom severity also underperformed in the crystal
collection task during the cognitive load condition compared to those with mild or nonexistent
ADHD symptoms ( Mhi= 20.78, SD= 5.33; Mlo= 21.67, SD= 4.52), again with a significant
interaction between ADHD status and load condition ( F(1, 226) = 5.54, p= .018). This pattern
was not observed in the baseline or perceptual load conditions.
Experiment 2
Participants. Participants in this experiment were recruited from the participant pool of the
Communication Department at a large university in the western United States and from the
general community surrounding the university. A total of 36 participants (23 female, 13 male,
Mage= 19.76) were recruited —18 participants with high-ADHD symptom severity and 18 par-
ticipants with low-ADHD symptom severity. Participants were recruited using a survey pre-
screener with the same cutoff points as were used in Experiment 1 —ASRS ≥3.2 for the
high-ADHD group and ASRS ≤2.0 for the low-ADHD group. Those whose ASRS scores were
above the high-ADHD cutoff or below the low-ADHD cutoff were contacted by a researcher
and invited to schedule a brain imaging appointment. Participants were asked to refrain from
taking any ADHD medication for at least 12 hours before their appointment. Data from twoparticipants were excluded due to equipment malfunction.
Scanning parameters and preprocessing. All brain imaging data were collected on a 3T Siemens
Magnetom Prisma (TR = 400 ms, TE = 35 ms, flip angle = 52°, acquisition matrix = 64 × 64, in-plane resolution = 3 mm
3). Upon arriving in the Brain Imaging Center, participants provided
informed consent, and filled out a metal-screening form. After this, participants spent approx-
imately 10 minutes seated at a laptop practicing the video game task that they would be per-
forming in the scanner. Upon completing the practice task, participants changed into scrubsand a researcher positioned them in the scanner, where they underwent a T1 structural scan
followed by the video game task, a T2 structural scan, and a short gambling task which is not
reported here. Functional runs included three 600-volume repetitions within each condition(baseline, cognitive load, perceptual load).
All brain imaging data were preprocessed with fMRIprep , a Nipype based tool ( Esteban
et al., 2019 ;Gorgolewski et al., 2011 ), and with xcpEngine , a supplemental pipeline for
denoising data used in function al connectivity analyses ( C i r i ce ta l . ,2 0 1 7 ;Lydon-Staley
et al., 2019 ). Each T1w volume was corrected for intensity nonuniformity using N4 bias field
correction from the ANTs registration suite ( Avants et al., 2011 ), and then skull-stripped using
the OASIS template provided by ANTs. Brain surfaces were reconstructed using FreeSurfer
(Dale et al., 1999 ), and spatially normalized to the ICBM 152 nonlinear asymmetrical template
(version 2009c) using ANTs. Brain tissue seg mentation was performed using FSL FAST
(Jenkinson et al., 2012 ). Functional data were slice time corrected using the 3dTShift function
from the AFNI software package ( Cox, 1996 ) and motion corrected using FSL MCFLIRT.
Following this, functional data were coreg istered to the T1w anatomical image using
boundary-based registration with 6 degrees of freedom ( Greve & Fischl, 2009 ). Motion correct-
ing transformations, BOLD to T1w transformation, and registration of the T1w to the MNI tem-
plate were conducted using ANTs. ICA-based AROMA was used to generate aggressive noise
regressors and to create output files that are nonaggressively denoised. Further preprocessingconducted in xcpEngine included denoising time series data based on the ICA-AROMA and
global signal, and white matter confounds generated by fMRIPrep, and conducting temporal
band-pass filtering (0.01 < f < 0.15 Hz) to reduce the influence of low-frequency drift andhigh-frequency physiological noise.

"Network creation and analysis. After preprocessing, each run was divided into eight nonover-
lapping segments of 75 TRs, and the mean signal was extracted from the prewhitened timeseries in each of 264 regions of interest (ROIs) as defined in Power et al. (2011) . Edges were
constructed pairwise between each node with edge weights assigned as the correlation
between the time series extracted from each pair of regions, resulting in a matrix of Pearson ’s
R values (see Figure 3 ). Network efficiency was calculated within each chunk as the inverse of
the average shortest path distance between each pair of nodes in the whole-brain network
(M= .19, SD= .012). Following previous studies (see, e.g., Lydon-Staley et al., 2019 ), we only
considered positively weighted edges, setting a ll negative edges to zero. Efficiency scores
between high-ADHD and low-ADHD groups in each condition were compared using a linear
mixed-effects model fit using the lmer() function from the lme4 package in R. ADHD status and
experimental condition were treated as fixed effects. Random intercepts and slopes were
included for each participant and for each condition, run, and segment nested within each
participant.
Results. In the second experiment, we sought to elucidate a candidate neural mechanism for
the ADHD-specific influence of cognitive and perceptual load we observed in Experiment 1.Of primary interest was global efficiency —the inverse of the average shortest path length
between nodes in the whole-brain functional connectivity network. Results show that under
cognitive load, those in the high-ADHD group had lower global efficiency than the
low-ADHD group, but that this pattern was reversed in the perceptual load condition (seeFigure 4 ). These efficiency differences that we observed between high-ADHD and low-ADHD

"groups seem to be driven by varying patterns of connectivity in attention-related brain net-
works, including the fronto-parietal control network, the salience network, and the ventral
attention network (see Supporting Information Figure S4 ;https://osf.io/9byvq/?view_only
=49b1b33ec5c14766b534f57d3d8606f2 ). Furthermore, we observed that the relationship
between brain network efficiency and RTV was contingent upon task condition. Increased
global efficiency was associated with higher RTV in the baseline and perceptual load condi-
tions, ( β= .025, p< .001), but was associated with lower RTV in the cognitive load condition
(β=−.17, p< .001), suggesting that increased RTV during cognitive load in those with high-
ADHD symptoms may be at least partially attributable to a decrease in network efficiency in
the brain.
Experiment 3
Participants. Participants in Experiment 3 were recruited using an online sample from the
online service Prolific Academic. In total, 825 participants completed the prescreener for
the experiment, for which they earned $5. Participants who self-reported an ADHD diagnosis,and who also met the minimum symptom severity thresholds established in Experiment 1 were
invited to complete the second half of the experiment, along with a matched group of those
who reported having never been diagnosed with ADHD, and whose reported ADHD symptomseverity was below the cutoff outlined above. As in Experiment 2, participants were asked torefrain from taking their ADHD medication for at least 12 hours before participating. As an
additional check, participants were also asked to report if they had taken their medication
within the last 12 hours, and none reported having done so. One hundred participantscompleted the second half of the experiment (50 ADHD, 50 non-ADHD, 36 female, 64 male,
M
age= 30.22). All participants provided informed consent and earned an additional $5 for
their participation in the second half of the experiment.
Experimental design. Participants played a browser-based (WebGL) version of Asteroid Impact
created using the Unity game design software. In order to ensure minimal lag in reporting reac-
tion times and other in-game events due to internet speeds and ping times, all game loggingwas performed on participants ’local machines, and then uploaded at the end of each round to
a server. Participants were required to complete the game on a personal computer with a
screen at least 11 ”in size, and that has a mouse pointer rather than a touchscreen interface.
Participants completed seven rounds of gameplay in total —a 1-minute practice round and two

"3-minute rounds in each condition. All rounds following the practice round were presented in
randomized order. After all levels were completed, participants were thanked for their submis-
sion and dismissed.
Analysis. As in Experiment 1, all analyses were conducted in R and all data were subjected to
minimal preprocessing. All main effects were tested using linear mixed-effects models. Cogni-
tive load, perceptual load, and ADHD diagnosis were treated as fixed effects, and were coded
using effects coding. Random intercepts were included for each participant. All reported betasare standardized. As in Experiment 1, correction for multiple comparisons was conducted
using the Tukey method.
Results. In the third experiment, ( N= 100) we extended the findings of Experiments 1 and 2,
recruiting a nonstudent sample and conducting the experiment in a more ecologically valid
setting —online, on participants ’personal computers in their own homes. To do so, we devel-
oped an online version of the video game task used in experiment one and two. We againobserved an ADHD-specific influence of both cognitive and perceptual load on both RTV
(F(1, 98) = 3.67, p= .03) and task performance ( F(1, 98) = 39.88, p< .001, see Figure 5 ).
Replicating Experiment 1, those with ADHD exhibited lower RTV than those without ADHDduring perceptual load ( M
ADHD =7 9 5 . 0 7 , MN-ADHD = 937.91). The opposite pattern was
observed during cognitive load, in which those with ADHD exhibited higher RTV than those
without ADHD ( MADHD = 1,114.51, MN-ADHD = 928.26). As in experiment one, those with
ADHD underperformed compared to those without ADHD during the baseline condition(M
ADHD = 40.97, MN-ADHD = 41.92), and outperformed those without ADHD during percep-
tual load ( MADHD = 35.71, MN-ADHD = 34.41).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we provide evidence that cognitive control performance in ADHD during
a naturalistic task is contingent on both cognitive load and perceptual load. Cognitive load
had a detrimental impact on performance, RTV, and brain network efficiency across both
ADHD and non-ADHD groups, but it had a disproportionately negative influence on thosewith ADHD, widening the gap in performance between non-ADHD and ADHD groups. In
contrast, perceptual load eliminated differences in brain network efficiency between ADHD
and non-ADHD groups, and in some cases driving the ADHD group to perform better andrespond less variably to reaction time probes than the non-ADHD group. Our results provide

"evidence for the task-dependent nature of ADHD-related neural and behavioral differences
and highlight the usefulness of a “modding ”approach to incorporate controlled manipulations
into a naturalistic task. These results reveal rich information regarding when and why ADHD
individuals may perform less optimally than those without ADHD, and how performance in
ADHD may be improved by modifying the parameters of a task.
Cognitive Load Magnifies Behavioral and Neural Indicators of ADHD Symptoms
Previous studies have focused on the distraction-magnifying influence of cognitive load inattention-demanding tasks ( Kelley & Lavie, 2011 ), and have suggested that differential suscep-
tibility to cognitive load (e.g., via reduced working memory capacity) may be linked to sub-
optimal cognitive performance in those with ADHD ( Roberts et al., 2012 ). In the present study,
we demonstrate that increased cognitive load has a detrimental influence on task performanceand RTV in both ADHD and non-ADHD individuals, but that those with ADHD are compar-
atively more affected. We also show that this relationship is observable under both categorical
and continuous characterizations of ADHD symptoms. During the cognitive load condition,those with ADHD performed worse in the video game task, had higher RTV, and had lower
brain network efficiency than those without ADHD.
Our results regarding brain network efficiency can also be interpreted in light of recurrent
observations that those with ADHD exhibit decreased efficiency in resting state and task-
evoked brain networks (for a review, see Konrad & Eickhoff, 2010 ), as well as aberrant mod-
ulation of default mode and fronto-parietal attention networks ( Castellanos & Proal, 2012 ).
These modulations have also been linked to trial-to-trial variation in attentional lapses ( Prado
et al., 2011 ). Increased global efficiency in functional brain networks has been linked with
greater performance in cognitive tasks ( Hearne et al., 2017 ). As such, reconfiguration of global
brain networks in those with ADHD in response to increasing cognitive load could be
expected to result in less efficient network topologies —and to result in decreased performance
in the task.
Although lower performance in ADHD has previously been observed in highly controlled
cognitive tasks (such as dual choice or flanker tasks), this study is the first to show an ADHD-
specific influence of cognitive load in comparatively more “real-world ”task performance, and
to link differences in performance under cognitive load to variations in brain network effi-
ciency, a putative mechanism i n multiple models of ADHD (e.g., Castellanos & Aoki,
2016 ). Connecting aberrant patterns of functional connectivity with symptom domains is a
fundamental question within ADHD research ( Castellanos & Proal, 2012 ). Our observation
that those with ADHD perform worse and have lower brain network efficiency under cognitive
load suggests that linking naturalistic task performance with indices of brain network topology
could provide informative neurobiological signatures distinguishing clinically relevant featuresof ADHD and predicting both symptoms and responsivity to treatment in these individuals.
Perceptual Load Minimizes ADHD-Related Performance Deficits and Behavioral Variability
A growing body of research demonstrates that perceptual load may be beneficial to cognitive
performance in ADHD when compared to non-ADHD groups ( Forster et al., 2014 ). It has
remained unclear, though, whether the benefits of increased perceptual load for those withADHD are limited to basic, highly controlled cognitive tasks, or whether they are observable
in more naturalistic task performance. Here, we demonstrate that increased perceptual load
during video game play has a positive influence on both performance and RTV in those withADHD. Whereas those with ADHD underperformed those without ADHD under cognitive

"load, they usually outperformed those without ADHD under perceptual load. Our results also
provide evidence that intraindividual RTV —a consistently observed ADHD phenotype ( Kofler
et al., 2013 ;Tamm et al., 2012 )—is modulated by perceptual load. Individuals with ADHD
were found to be more variable than those without ADHD during cognitive load but were less
variable under perceptual load.
These findings augment recent work suggesting that perceptual load may act to eliminate
variability in ADHD attributable to cognitive control deficits ( Forster et al., 2014 ). The Load
Theory of Selective Attention and Cognitive Control ( Lavie et al., 2004 ) suggests that percep-
tual load shifts the balance of attentional selection mechanisms away from executive control
and toward more bottom-up filtering and selection. It follows, then, that the addition of per-
ceptual load may enable those with ADHD to leverage relative strengths in sensory integrationand perception abilities while minimizing their reliance on cognitive control mechanisms.Indeed, ADHD is associated with increased local efficiency in brain networks ( Lin et al.,
2014 ), a topological signature associated with increased performance in perceptual discrimi-
nation tasks ( Weiss et al., 2011 ). Further supporting this conclusion is recent work showing that
the addition of conflicting dialog (increasing cognitive load) within a naturalistic, multitalker
conversation desynchronizes brain activity between individuals with ADHD, but that intro-
ducing white noise (perceptual load) does not ( Salmi et al., 2020 ).
Neurobiologically informed video games have recently been introduced as potential inter-
ventions for improving ADHD symptoms ( Mishra et al., 2016 ), highlighting neural signatures
of distractor suppression and interference resolution as useful targets for intervention. Relatedwork shows that those who habitually play action video games seem to exhibit increased
attention, cognitive control, and working memory abilities compared to their peers (see,
e.g., Cardoso-Leite et al., 2016 ;Green & Bavelier, 2003 ). In contrast, sustained engagement
in other media is associated with decreased performance in these same domains. Those who
frequently engage in media multitasking (concurrently doing two or more media tasks) exhibit
reduced cognitive control and have higher self-reported symptoms of ADHD ( Uncapher et al.,
2016 ). These findings highlight the necessity of developing better understanding regarding
how individual differences in media habits influence (and are influenced by) cognitive indi-
vidual differences.
Conclusions
In three experiments, we showed that ADHD-specific variation in task performance and func-tional connectivity is modulated by both cognitive load and perceptual load. Cognitive loaddisproportionately degrades performance, RTV, and brain network efficiency in ADHD,
whereas perceptual load has largely opposite effects —minimizing observable differences
between ADHD and non-ADHD. These results demonstrate that performance and neural effi-ciency gaps between ADHD and non-ADHD groups can be minimized or even eliminated
when task parameters are changed. This work aligns with a growing collection of evidence
showing that changes in cognition and attention during task performance are reflected inchanges in brain network topology and dynamics ( Rosenberg et al., 2020 ), and that these pat-
terns of variations can reveal information about underlying clinical conditions that is largely
inaccessible using other methods ( Finn et al., 2018 ;Guo et al., 2015 ;Salmi et al., 2020 ). Taken
together, our findings indicate a number of future research opportunities at the intersection ofneuroscience and media design that leverage video game “modding ”to generate naturalistic
tasks that nonetheless vary along theoretically relevant continua. This work stands to contrib-
ute to greater understanding of complex disorders like ADHD and to the development oftargeted interventions to improve cognitive performance.

Teaching with a multisensory approach helps students link new information to prior 
knowledge and understand relationships between concepts. This study aimed to reflect on 
convergences between the Multisensory Integration Approach Model with the Learning 
Assimilation Theory and Meaningful Retention with Bloom’s Cognitive Process Domain, 
and to propose a taxonomic table of lesson planning for teaching Acute Coronary Syndrome, 
considering the confluence of these references. The three frameworks consider the importance 
of students’ prior knowledge, the process of abstraction and generalization of knowledge, and 
the relationship between working and long-term memory. By observing such convergences 
and the taxonomic table produced, it is observed that teaching topics of interest to nursing 
undergraduate students, adopting the Multisensory Integration Approach Model as a 
taxonomic table component (pre-organizing or recall activities to arouse different sensory 
perceptions aligned with instructional objectives and forms of assessment), in the light of 
the Learning Assimilation Theory and Meaningful Retention, has the potential to favor the 
reception and processing of instructional content.

Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2022;56:e20210381INTRODUCTION
Education involves two distinct and integrated processes: 
teaching and learning. Learning is the process of entering, pro -
cessing and storing information in the cognitive system, as well 
as any persistent change in behavioral attributes, produced by 
the action of experience in the central nervous system(1).
Specifically, multisensory learning is a process that consists 
of learning a new subject through the use of two or more sen -
ses, which may include visual, auditory, tactile or synesthetic, 
olfactory, and gustatory sensation(2).
Teaching consists of creating favorable conditions for lear -
ning to occur(3). In particular, teaching with a multisensory 
approach provides additional ways of receiving information 
into students’ cognitive system by stimulating hearing, vision, 
touch, speech, taste, movement and action, helping students to 
link new information to prior knowledge and to understand the 
relationships between concept(4). 
The definitions of multisensory learning and teaching are 
consistent with the fact that, along the sensory pathways, rela -
tively simple information is transformed into complex forms, 
the basis of cognition(5).
Receptors for each of the sensory systems provide neural 
representation of the external world so that information from 
the sense organs flows centrally to the brain regions involved 
in cognition(5). Moreover, interactions occur between the visual, 
auditory, and somatosensory cortex with the prefrontal cortex(6), 
which supports several higher cognitive processes, including 
perception, memory, and metacognition(7). It is known that 
low-level sensory integration (visual-auditory) or high-level 
sensory integration (visual-auditory-tactile-olfactory-gustatory) 
occurs in the human brain, involving coordination, attention, 
autonomic function, emotions, cognitive functions of high level 
and memory(8).
Teaching focused on sensory integration plays a vital role in 
improving working memory(2), which is understood as “a tem -
porary network that sustains current processing contents” and 
has subsidiary systems (capable of retaining information based 
on speech and information related to visual perception) an exe -
cutive center capable of manipulating the results of perceptual 
processing with information stored in long-term memory(9). 
Multisensory education training can enhance learning and 
support successful, creative and sustainable career development 
in complex work environments(10), as multisensory processes are 
critical to perception, cognition, learning, and behavior(6). 
In undergraduate nursing education, some studies have been 
carried out to explore undergraduate students’ attention and 
sensory perceptions, developing teaching focused on a mul -
tisensory approach in classes using traditional(11–13) or active 
methodologies(14). In these studies, diversified resources were 
used, such as peas, chocolate and candy packaging(12), multi -
colored buttons, gloves, ear protectors(12), balloons, drawing of 
human heart on the classroom floor, cardboard, ribbons and 
colored cards(13), bright and colorful poster-size visual collages, 
children’s photographs and images of objects(14). 
 The authors of the aforementioned studies describe that 
such resources and approaches contributed to student learning, by favoring the understanding of teaching topics and key  
concepts(11–13), by facilitating information transfer, problem  
solving and critical thinking(13), and helping to form thoughts 
and ideas(14). In this perspective, research on multisensory lear -
ning is encouraged so that learning mechanisms and processes 
within natural settings can be better understood(15). Despite 
providing additional ways for students to receive informa -
tion, multisensory teaching is widely applied in the context of  
teaching and learning children with language and learning 
disorders, and little explored in depth in other subjects(16). 
A way to stimulate sensory perception and encourage stu -
dents’ participation in the construction of their learning, in an 
expository class with dialogue inside a classroom, is propo -
sed by Prasannakumar and Saminathan(8), who describe the 
Multisensory Integration Approach Model (MIAM) as con -
sisting of seven steps. These steps relate to “how” to conduct a 
class using the multisensory integration approach.
In step 1, “Relating new information”, there is a discussion 
in the room to identify previous knowledge; in step 2, “Focusing 
attention to the information”, there is use of innovative illus -
trations, gestures, provision of information through visual, 
auditory and tactile discrimination and repetition of ideas; in 
step 3, “Developing sensory connection”, there is use of ver -
bal and non-verbal cues using visual and auditory sensation 
and then tactile sensation; in step 4, “Organizing the informa -
tion”, graphic organizers are used through visual and auditory 
resources, with the objective of clarifying and clarifying students’  
concepts; in step 5, “Expanding sensory images”, there is provi -
sion of role-play and simulation techniques, analogies and meta -
phors to improve students’ sensory image and provision of tasks 
that require hand-eye coordination to integrate concepts; in  
step 6, “Structuring the information”, a problem is presented 
to be solved using the auditory system and images, and activi -
ties are provided for tactile conceptualization and formulation 
of hypotheses and generalizations about concepts; in step 7, 
“Practicing recall”, working memory is considered with repeti -
tion of information, mnemonic techniques are used and students 
must be able to recall and recognize information using auditory 
and visual memory(8). 
Prasannakummar and Saminathan(17) carried out an inter -
vention study for science teaching, with an experimental group 
(using MIAM) and a control group (traditional teaching 
method), and concluded that MIAM improved student per -
formance and contributed to a “meaningful and joyful learning”, 
suggesting that multisensory integration be used at all educa -
tional levels, in order to optimize learning.
MIAM has the potential to favor/optimize students’ lear -
ning. When inserted in lesson planning, in line with instructio -
nal objectives and the desired assessment format, it is possible 
to create an external environment in the classroom that arouse 
different sensory perceptions, with the potential to help in the 
existing relationship between working memory and long-term 
memory (new subjects and previous knowledge). Indeed, activi -
ties that require movement and the sense of touch make students 
dynamically participate in their education, rather than passively 
absorbing information through their eyes and ears(18).",paper20.pdf,2

The observation of MIAM’s seven steps, in a reflective pers -
pective, allows an approximation of it with David Ausubel’s 
Learning Assimilation Theory and Meaningful Retention (when 
observing the way of conducting the seven steps), and of MIAM 
with Bloom’s Taxonomy (when looking at the verbs of the seven 
steps). 
Therefore, the present theoretical study aims to: 1) Reflect 
on the existing convergences between MIAM with David 
Ausubel’s Learning Assimilation Theory and Meaningful 
Retention (LATMR) and with Bloom’s Cognitive Process 
Domain, in order to expand the look at lesson planning (cons -
truction of instructional objectives, activities to be carried out 
during the class, learning assessment formats); 2) Propose 
a Taxonomic Table of lesson planning for teaching Acute 
Coronary Syndrome, in the confluence of these frameworks 
(MIAM, LATMR, and Bloom).
To this end, four sections will be presented below. The first 
will discuss on the LATMR; the second, on Bloom’s Cognitive 
Process Domain, to later discuss, in the third section, conver -
gences between them and propose (in the fourth section) an 
educational activity with a Taxonomic table of lesson planning 
for teaching Acute Coronary Syndrome for nursing students, 
at the confluence of these frameworks. 
LEARNING ASSIMILATION THEORY AND 
MEANINGFUL RETENTION 
The LATMR is defined by its author, David Ausubel, as  
a theory of “the way in which human beings apprehend and 
retain large sets of organized material in the classroom and 
similar learning environments”(19).
David Ausubel points out that it is likely that cognitive 
factors and interpersonal motivation interact, influencing the 
learning process, and that this process involves relationships with 
other individuals. However, he cuts the scope of his theory into 
cognitive aspects, such as principles of cognitive organization 
and interaction and cognitive mechanisms(19). Therefore, the 
meaningful learning described by David Ausubel consists in 
selective anchoring (linking) of the learning material to relevant 
ideas, existing in students’ cognitive structure, and in the interac -
tions between them, in a non-arbitrary way, where the meaning 
of what was introduced emerges as a product of interaction as 
well as the connection of the new meaning with corresponding 
ideas in the memory interval (retention)(19).
Anchored ideas are called subsumptions, and “factors that 
influence the clarity and stability of subsuming ideas are likely 
to include repetition (recall), use of copies, and multicontextual 
exposition”(19).
Ausubel(19) highlights that students’ prior knowledge is 
essential for discussion of a new subject, and that the repeti -
tion of a subject improves learning in two different ways. One 
is that repetition consolidates learned material more effectively 
when performed shortly after initial learning (before much of 
the forgetting has taken place). Furthermore, repetition can 
act in a scenario of ambiguous and unstable subsumptions, 
which provide weak anchoring for new information/concepts, constituting a factor influencing the clarity and stability of sub -
sumption ideas(18).
Another point of LATMR, which is worth mentioning in 
the scope of this study, is the observation that learners’/stu -
dents’ cognitive structure can be systematically influenced by 
the methods of content presentation, when using an organized 
and pre-tested instructional material(19).
There are two important principles in expository teaching: 
principles of progressive differentiation and integrative recon -
ciliation in instructional materials so that the former recognizes 
that learning and its retention are hierarchical, i.e., it occurs 
by performing abstraction, then generalization and inclusion. 
Integrative reconciliation, on the other hand, is facilitated in 
expository teaching if teacher and/or teaching materials expli -
citly anticipate and counterattack the confusing similarities and 
differences between new ideas and ideas already anchored in 
learners’ cognitive structure(19).
The use of pre-organizers at the beginning of a class/training 
can provide an anchor-shaped structure for students to grasp 
the new material(20), playing the role of mediator between the 
particular content of the task of learning and the more general  
content of ideas potentially anchored in learners’ cognitive  
structure(19). In this regard, pre-organizers, understood as a 
general concept or pedagogical mechanism, can be offered as a 
diagram, flowchart, a general word or a sentence(20). 
In addition to using pre-organizers, teachers can maximize 
learning and retention of their students’ learning in different 
ways, either by making regular stimulus changes and using color 
and movement, or by making changes in teaching methods, 
using gestures to help students to focus and identify important 
content for their learning(20).
BLOOM’S TAXONOMY: COGNITIVE  
PROCESS DOMAIN
Bloom’s Taxonomy of Cognitive Process Domain is used 
in Higher Education(21,22). It is an instrument to develop lear -
ning objectives, to direct the teaching and learning process, and 
to assess whether or not the desired mental action has been 
demonstrated by students(23), as it favors a hierarchical organiza -
tion according to levels of complexity and desired and planned 
cognitive development goals(24). 
For Bloom, everyone learns, but there are differences  
regarding the level of depth and abstraction of embedded  
knowledge(24). Cognitive process domain categories involve the 
acquisition of new knowledge, as well as intellectual develop -
ment, skills and attitudes, so that the six categories are presented 
in a hierarchical structure in complexity, from the simplest to the 
most complex, from the concrete to the abstract, where to ascend 
in a category it is necessary to obtain adequate performance in 
the previous category(24), as shown in Figure 1.
The category “Remember” is closely related to the process 
of retaining the content presented in long-term memory, while 
the other five are related to the transfer process(25).
An important aspect of the aforementioned Taxonomy refers 
to the degree of correspondence between instructional objec -
tives, instructions (activities) and assessment, a degree that is ",paper20.pdf,3

Rev Esc Enferm USP · 2022;56:e20210381verified by comparing objectives with assessment, objectives 
with instruction, and instruction with assessment. Such com -
parisons are easier to perform when the Taxonomic Table, so 
called by its authors, is used; however, its format is a table, in 
which the columns illustrate the cognitive processes and the 
lines the dimension of knowledge(25).
The dimensions of knowledge, according to Bloom’s 
Taxonomy, include factual, conceptual and procedural kno -
wledge. Factual knowledge means knowledge of discrete and 
isolated content elements, which includes knowledge of ter -
minology and knowledge of specific details and elements(25). 
Procedural knowledge means “Knowledge of how to do 
something”, including knowledge of skills and algorithms, tech -
niques and methods, as well as knowledge of the criteria used 
to determine and/or justify “when to do what” within domains 
and specific subjects. By conceptual knowledge, we mean the 
“more complex and organized” forms of knowledge, and inclu -
des knowledge of classifications and categories, principles and 
generalizations, theories, models and structure(25).
CONVERGENCES BETWEEN MIAM, LATMR AND 
BLOOM TAXONOMY’S COGNITIVE PROCESS 
DOMAIN
The elements that reflect approximations and conver -
gences between MIAM and LATMR, and between MIAM  
and Bloom’s Cognitive Process Domain, consist of obser -
vation and comparison of MIAM steps with the concepts 
explained and defended in LATMR and with Bloom’s 
Cognitive Processes.
LATMR and MIAM emphasize the importance of students’ 
prior knowledge and the repetition of ideas (recall). To this end, 
copies and pre-organizers/graphic organizers can be used and 
information can be offered through organized and pre-tested instructional materials with visual, auditory and tactile discri -
mination, or through verbal and non-verbal cues that involve 
students to paraphrase information with sensations coming 
from the sense organs. One can also carry out the attack and 
counterattack of similarities and differences and techniques of 
dramatization, simulation, analogies, metaphors and hand-eye 
coordination, facilitating progressive differentiation through the 
presentation of a problem to be discussed using auditory system, 
images and tact to form hypotheses and generalize.
Bloom’s Cognitive Process Domain categories and MIAM 
are similar, as MIAM steps are configured as a “way” of 
working the instructional content in the classroom (to favor 
content reception or processing, aiming at the reach of diffe -
rent cognitive abilities, according to the cognitive processes 
involved), or are configured as a necessary condition (impor -
tance of evoking previous knowledge) to reach the desired 
instructional objectives. Figure 2 shows in detail the steps 
of MIAM and its approximations to LATMR and Bloom’s 
Cognitive Process Domain.
The following is a proposal for the application of confluences 
illustrated in Figure 2 in the context of undergraduate students’ 
teaching and learning.
PROPOSAL FOR TEACHING ACUTE CORONARY 
SYNDROME FOR NURSING UNDERGRADUATE 
STUDENTS WITH ACTIVITIES AIMED AT SENSORY 
INTEGRATION
For the purposes of reflection and approximation of MIAM 
to the educational scenario in nursing, in the light of LATMR 
and Bloom’s Cognitive Process Domain, a topic of global rele -
vance for teaching nursing students was listed, Acute Coronary 
Syndrome (ACS), as ischemic heart disease is the leading cause

of death in the world, accounting for 8.9 million (16%) deaths 
in 2019(26).
It is noteworthy that this proposal aims to make connections 
between instructional objectives, activities with multisensory 
integration approach performed in the classroom and learning 
assessment, considering as a target audience nursing undergra -
duates who have already attended subjects of anatomy, physio -
logy and human histology and pharmacology. The intention is 
not to replace strategies and resources that each teacher can 
adopt in their lesson planning, but to aggregate and raise con -
siderations about another way to teach this theme, according 
to its insertion in the subject focused on nursing care for adults 
and older adults.
In more detail, to design the suggested teaching proposal, 
the following steps were followed: 1) Definition of the strategy 
to be adopted to conduct the proposal (dialogued exposition); 
2) Adoption of LATMR for the development of the proposal, 
by understanding nursing students as actors in their learning 
process, with previous knowledge about anatomy, physio -
logy, human histology and pharmacology; 3) Use of Bloom’s 
Taxonomy for planning the proposal, as it is a didactic-peda -
gogical instrument that helps in the elaboration of instructio -
nal objectives and in the observation of the correspondence 
between them with the instruction carried out and assessment 
learning items(25); 4) Determination that MIAM will be used 
specifically as a guide for the development of instructional acti -
vities aimed at sensory integration to practice recall or to offer 
pre-organizers (elements described in LATMR as factors that 
favor the learning process).The principle adopted for the teaching proposal consisted 
of conducting the class with a dialogued expository strategy in 
the on-site modality, using instructional resources that require 
low financial investment (in order not to compromise its imple -
mentation and replication). It is important to highlight that the 
suggested activities can be improved (being only an initial draft) 
and developed in a dialogued exhibition class, with the use of 
multimedia resources and household/stationery materials. These 
materials may be provided by students or adapted/replaced by 
similar objects from teachers’ prior request.
Chart 1 describes the instructional objectives, their  
respective activities with a multisensory integration appro -
ach and ways of assessing learning in the light of LATMR,  
considering Bloom’s Taxonomy of Cognitive 
Processes Dimension.
After this stage of elaboration of instructional objectives for 
activities with multisensory integration approach and assess -
ment formats, a taxonomic table was built, which summari -
zes the framework/correspondence of instructional objectives, 
planned activities and assessment formats in the dimensions of 
knowledge and dimensions of cognitive processes, simultaneou -
sly, according to Chart 2.
Looking the taxonomic table (Chart 2) offers teachers an 
overview of the teaching process, enabling them to visualize 
the type of assessment that is most coherent with the instruc -
tional objective to be achieved and which activity to develop to 
achieve instructional objectives distributed among knowledge 
and cognitive process domains. ",paper20.pdf,5

CONCLUSION
Convergences between MIAM, LATMR and Bloom’s 
Taxonomy Cognitive Process Domain consist of the fact that 
these three frameworks consider the importance of students’ 
prior knowledge, the process of abstraction and depth of kno -
wledge, and the relationship between working and long-term 
memory. 
Such convergences can be perceived in a taxonomic table for 
teaching ACS, in which MIAM is configured as a component 
of this table, aiming at sensory perceptions during the conduct of a class with the performance of pre-organizing or recall acti -
vities, which provide different ways to promote the reception 
and processing of learning contents within classroom. 
In the context of undergraduate nursing, randomized clinical 
trials are necessary to verify the real effect of teaching, using 
MIAM in undergraduate students’ learning and based on guiding 
frameworks, such as Bloom’s Taxonomy in light of LATMR. 
Studies with qualitative methodology are also indispensable to 
understand teaching with this approach, from undergraduate 
students’ perspective, regarding the affective aspects and inter -
personal motivation that permeate the learning process.
RESUMO 
Ensinar com abordagem multissensorial auxilia o aluno a vincular informações novas ao conhecimento prévio e a entender relações entre 
conceitos. O objetivo deste estudo é refletir sobre convergências entre o Modelo de Abordagem de Integração Multissensorial com a Teoria 
da Assimilação da Aprendizagem e da Retenção Significativas com o Domínio dos Processos Cognitivos de Bloom, e propor uma tabela 
taxonômica de planejamento de aula para o ensino de Síndrome Coronariana Aguda, tendo em vista a confluência desses referenciais. Os 
três referenciais consideram a importância do conhecimento prévio do aluno, do processo de abstração e generalização do conhecimento e 
o relacionamento entre memória de trabalho e de longo prazo. Ao observar tais convergências e a tabela taxonômica produzida, observa-se 
que ensinar temas de interesse para graduandos de enfermagem, adotando o Modelo de Abordagem de Integração Multissensorial como 
um componente da tabela taxonômica (atividades pré-organizadoras ou de recall  para suscitar diferentes percepções sensoriais alinhadas aos 
objetivos instrucionais e formas de avaliação), à luz da Teoria da Assimilação da Aprendizagem e da Retenção Significativas, tem potencial para 
favorecer a recepção e o processamento de conteúdos de instrução.

Abstract 
It is becoming increasingly clear that not all students require the same education, 
and the requirement of personalized education is increasingly in demand. The incor ‑
poration of adaptive learning (AL) has increased in recent years. However, research 
on this subject is still evolving at the university level. In this study, we investigated 
the impact of integrating an AL tool (CogBooks®) in a university course (statistics 
for decision making) taught in an innovative online modality called FIT (flexible, inter ‑
active, and with technology), in which the course is designed in the CANVAS® platform 
and uses Zoom® as a means of communication with students. Learning outcomes 
were compared between the FIT courses with or without AL and between AL strate ‑
gies in online and face ‑to‑face courses. It was clear that AL improved the students’ 
achievement regardless of the modality. In addition, we conclude that students 
achieve better in AL courses in the classroom than in distance courses. Satisfaction 
surveys favor a preference for FIT courses with AL over classroom classes with AL. Our 
results suggest that AL is a solid strategy for teaching undergraduate courses.

Introduction
Nowadays, technological developments present an opportunity to generate customized 
teaching by allowing students to choose their learning path (Alamri et al., 2021). To meet 
each student’s educational needs to improve their knowledge and increase their engage -
ment, personalized learning emerged (Alamri et  al., 2020; Walkington & Bernacki, 
2020). Personalized learning refers to an educational strategy where the objectives, the 
sequence of the content, the learning pace, and the instruction can vary according to the 
student’s needs (Peng et al., 2019). There are different ways of approaching personalized 
learning, one of which is Adaptive Learning (AL) (Waters, 2014).
However, although AL is not entirely new, it is not easy to define and continually 
evolves (Cavanagh et al., 2020). According to Martin et al. (2020), the objective of AL 
is to generate a unique learning experience taking into account the individual differ -
ences of the student, either defined as a process (focusing on how the contents are 
presented to the student, which is adapted depending on the increase in the under -
standing of the material, measured as the results obtained in the evaluations), as well 
as their preferences about the type of materials, or technological devices and soft -
ware. AL strategies are focused on generating learning experiences based on the 
student’s previous knowledge on their learning outcomes; all this is supported by 
technologies (software) that allow knowing the student’s progress and obtaining data 
to modify instruction according to the results (Peng et al., 2019).
The essence of adaptive systems allows students to approach the contents and 
advance the material at their own pace, as fast or slow as the instructor or the course 
structure allows (Dziuban et al., 2016). Additionally, the software is designed to pro -
vide continuous feedback, and adapt the content in response to how the student 
responds to the questions and activities; all this helps him/her to command the con -
tent (Bailey et al., 2018).",paper21.pdf,2

 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
 
The incorporation of AL systems has been carried out with different objectives by 
the educational institutions; some use it as a tool for the students to do their home -
work, perform exercises, and be a support mechanism throughout the course; in 
other cases, as part of remediation mechanisms and for those who need to reinforce 
their knowledge (Tyton Partners, 2016). Derived from the use of AL in universities, 
research has been generated focused on assessing the impact of its use in terms of 
improvement in learning outcomes, engagement, and retention, among others.
In a study conducted by Diziuban et al. (2017), the researchers sought to determine 
how students react and adjust to flexible learning environments that use AL in two 
universities (the University of Central Florida and Colorado Technical University). The 
results showed that although there were differences between institutions, students from 
both universities gave AL a high mark regarding effective education. In addition, most 
believe that AL gives them greater flexibility and helps them strengthen knowledge 
acquisition.
On the other hand, Wang et al. (2019) used a hierarchical knowledge structure to auto -
matically organize updated and compiled learning materials from the internet. They 
provided students with personalized materials that adapt to their language (Japanese) 
proficiency. The results showed that adapting the materials to the needs of each student 
increases their engagement with the course.
Additionally, in the study by Liu et al. (2017), the researchers sought to evaluate the 
impact of the use of AL as a tool for the remediation of knowledge of biology, chemistry, 
information literacy, and mathematics in students entering the pharmacy career (phar -
macy undergraduate program). The results showed that using AL significantly increased 
the knowledge of the remedial chemistry content; however, it did not have the same 
effect in the other disciplines.
Savio-Ramos (2015) investigated the effectiveness of personalized learning in increas -
ing high school algebra competence. One hundred and seventeen students participated 
(between 10 and 12th grade). They were assigned to two groups: (1) computer-based 
learning with the incorporation of a personalized learning platform and (2) the same 
learning environment without the AL platform. Both groups were subjected to a pre-test 
and post-test. The results showed that there was no learning gain in either group. How -
ever, those who used personalized learning had a more positive perception of personal -
ized learning than those of the traditional group.
In a case study conducted by the Boston Consulting Group in conjunction with Ari -
zona State University, the use of AL in Biology courses was incorporated, increasing 
by 2% the number of students who obtain grades between A and C in the groups using 
AL in mixed mode (face to face with online), concerning the traditional mixed modal -
ity (Bailey et al., 2018). In the case of Algebra, AL was incorporated in the online mode 
groups, and the increase in the percentage of students with A-B-C scores was 11% higher 
than in the mixed mode groups. On the other hand, at Georgia State University, the use 
of AL in introductory writing courses contributed to lowering the DFW rate (percent -
age of grades of D , F, or students who W ithdraw from the course) in minority students 
(Bailey et al., 2018).
Similarly, Colorado Technical University integrated its AL tool into its face-to-face 
Trigonometry and Pre-calculus courses, increasing the average pass rate from 76 to 94%, ",paper21.pdf,3
"Page 4 of 24 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
and average withdrawal rates decreased from 36 to 17% in Trigonometry. Similarly, the 
average pass rate in Precalculus increased from 66 to 94%, and average withdrawal rates 
decreased from 45 to 13%. Additionally, students who took courses with AL performed 
better in the following calculus courses (Daines et al., 2016).
Research gap and study objectives
Research-based evidence on the results of the incorporation of AL is still evolving at 
the university level. There is a lack of quantitative studies that demonstrate a difference 
in student’s grades and satisfaction when using integrated (sequence and structure) and 
contextualized AL strategies in higher education (Xie et al., 2019). The purpose of this 
research is to quantitatively evaluate the impact of incorporating the use of AL in higher 
education. We take, as a subject of study, a business statistics course, which is a subject 
belonging to the first semester of the Business program.
The main objective was two-fold: Firstly, to determine the effect of incorporating an 
AL strategy in the “Statistical Methods for Decision-making” course offered in a flexible, 
interactive, and with technology (FIT) modality (synchronous online). Secondly, assess -
ing in which modality the AL has the most significant effect on student performance, in 
courses in the classroom or FIT classes.
The hypothesis of our work is that students improve their academic performance 
when an AL strategy is used within the course. For this reason, we sought to evaluate AL 
in the learning modalities that were employed at our university at the time of the study. 
We wanted to answer the questions:
 Q1. Using an AL strategy, do students perform better (have better grades)?
 Q2. In what type of course does an AL strategy help students perform better?
 Q3. Does using an AL teaching strategy impact evaluating satisfaction with the learning 
experience?
Theoretical framework
Education is evolving with technology to improve quality and increase potential. Adap -
tive learning systems using machine learning offer a solution to individualized learning 
paths that can be time-consuming. By assessing knowledge and considering social-emo -
tional characteristics, education can be diversified and more effective, leading to fewer 
dropouts (Osadcha et al., 2021). The paradigm shift conveyed by AL consists of using 
data-based technology to identify specific needs based on the levels of performance 
achieved by each student to provide the most appropriate educational resources, activi -
ties, instruction, and feedback that the student needs at a specific time to reinforce his/
her performance (Dron, 2018).
Adaptive learning theory follows a teaching approach that tailors the educational 
experience to the individual learning style of each student. By leveraging data to cre -
ate a customized program, it considers various abilities and needs, rather than adhering 
to a predetermined path. This results in a personalized, data-driven learning experience 
(Sezgin & Yüzer, 2022).",paper21.pdf,4
"Page 5 of 24
 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
 
The framework for adaptive learning posits that individualized instruction is a cru -
cial component in achieving sustained academic progress and satisfaction (Clark 
et al., 2022). Considering the student learning performance, the theoretical framework 
adopted in this work corresponds to the Digital Technology—Personalized and Adap -
tive Learning student learning framework, developed by Singh and Alshammari (2021), 
which establishes three postulates:
1. Digital technology creates a smart learning environment, enabling efficient, effective, 
and comfortable personalized learning.
2. Digital technology can provide personalized and flexible learning to improve student 
performance.
3. The environment greatly influences educational institutions and complements the 
relationship between digital technology-enabled personalized and adaptive learning 
and student performance.
This theory is based on the Technology Organization Environment framework, devel -
oped by Tornatzky and Fleischer (1990), which presents a valuable instrument for scru -
tinizing the adoption and integration of various information technology innovations 
(Oliveira & Martins, 2011).
In this case, the environment (online or face-to-face modalities) enriched by AL tech -
nology could impact the student performance, this is, the test scores and final grades. 
On the other hand, to create an effective learning environment, it’s important to con -
tinuously assess and improve the course design process. Student feedback and learning 
theories should also be taken into consideration. Evaluation should be done in phases to 
address technical challenges and immediate concerns, and subsequently learner satisfac -
tion (Kruger, 2020). In this regard, learner satisfaction is how users perceive an informa -
tion system’s usefulness in achieving their goals. It reflects how students feel about their 
learning experiences and can impact their commitment to a program. High satisfaction 
leads to lower drop-out rates and higher persistence (Lim et al., 2022).
Study context and problem
Tecnologico de Monterrey launched the Tec21 Educational Model, which aims to develop 
skills and abilities required in the professional field. It offers challenge-based learning, 
inspiring Faculty, memorable experiences, and flexibility for students. The online FIT 
courses account for the last Tec21 component (Castillo-Reyna et al., 2020). In FIT courses, 
students from all national campuses from Tecnologico de Monterrey take a class (90 min) 
with nationally renowned professors via webconference in real time on defined days and 
times. Usually, these classes are taught through the video chat software program Zoom, 
twice a week. Students can find the course content, exercises, materials, and strategy on a 
Learning Management System (CANVAS; Instructure Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) platform.
The advantages of these courses are that the student has the flexibility to take the ses -
sions from any geographical location, interact with classmates from different campuses, 
as well as have personalized follow-up from the professor through various digital means. 
It includes a digital learning environment that integrates content, resources, and activi -
ties, as well as digital media for interaction.",paper21.pdf,5
"Page 6 of 24 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
In a routine review of the outcomes of the FIT courses, we found that the subject Sta -
tistical Methods for Decision Making was complicated for students (students didn’t have 
a good performance—non-passing averages). This is a basic course (first third of the 
career) that does require the student to have coursed basic mathematics in the business 
curriculum but may be difficult for its abstract concepts content. Thus, it was neces -
sary to give students tools so that they could increase their level of approval, level their 
knowledge, and get a better understanding. To solve this problem, we incorporated AL 
into the course. For this, we employed the CogBooks platform, which is an AL tool avail -
able on the market. However, as the tool was integrated into the didactic sequence of the 
class, the model was completely developed by us internally.
For the incorporation of CogBooks, it was necessary to redesign the course entirely. 
For this, FIT course faculty members were trained in AL and CogBooks. Additionally, 
they had the support of an instructional advisor to design a global strategy to integrate 
the class experience and the student duties and tasks in CANVAS and CogBooks. The 
AL strategy observed the following characteristics:
1. The course is organized hierarchically by topics covering specific learning objectives; 
each includes a set of concepts.
2. Within the AL platform, each concept presents a base content that can include 
video, text, and infographics, among other educational resources, and that has been 
designed with micro-learning principles.
3. In each basic content, the student is offered the option of indicating their degree of 
understanding of the material presented.
4. At least two additional reinforcement resources are included for those students who 
cannot understand the base content.
5. At the end of each topic, after reviewing all the concepts, an automated evaluation 
test is presented that the student can take two times.
6. The adaptive system allows for obtaining analytics on the evaluation tests and the 
students’ progress in the content review.
7. The instructor consults this information before each class session.
Figure 1 indicates the didactic sequence we follow in the present work.
The CogBooks platform gives students a personalized learning experience and imme -
diate feedback. Each subject of a course is divided into concepts and sub-concepts 
(Fig. 2).
For each sub-concept of the course, the student enters the platform and reviews the 
first teaching support entirely prepared by the instruction designers (Fig. 3).
After reading, the student shows his/her level of understanding based on a thermom -
eter included in the same tool (Fig. 4).
In case of having a degree of understanding greater than 50%, the platform displays a 
quiz about the topic (Fig. 5).
The student has two attempts to take the quiz, and the final grade is recorded. If 
the student gets a good grade (> 70/100) after the first attempt, the next topic will be 
reviewed. If he/she has a failing grade or enough but wants to improve it, the system 
recommends checking another booster support and retaking the quiz.  The next topic ",paper21.pdf,6
"Page 7 of 24
 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
 
will be reviewed if the student gets a good grade the second time. If he/she has a failing 
grade, the system recommends emailing the instructor through the platform. In case of 
having a degree of understanding less than 50%, the platform shows a second reinforc -
ing didactic support with a different format than the previous one. For example, if the 
first support was a text, now, a video can be displayed. This has the goal of impacting all 
the different types of student learning. After finishing reviewing the second resource, 
the student will have to self-select once again the degree of understanding through the 
thermometer. If it is more than 50%, the quiz will appear with the previously described 
process; otherwise, it will show you the third resource of reinforcement. After the revi -
sion of the third resource of reinforcement, whose format is different from the first two, 
the student must say if his/her degree of understanding is higher than 50% and therefore 
take the quiz corresponding, or if there is still doubt, the platform allows the student to

contact the instructor via email or REMIND (a direct message communication tool with 
the instructor) platform for personalized advice before taking the quiz.
In this work, we attempt to investigate if the proposed personalization strategy 
improves student performance and satisfaction, not only in FIT courses but also in 
traditional face-to-face formats.
Methodology
In this work, we employed a comparative quantitative methodology, since we meas -
ured the learning performance (exams and final term averages) and satisfaction 
(using a Likert scale), of students taking a course with AL, compared to a control 
group.

Participants
This work was conducted for one year and six months, divided into three semesters: 
August-December (Year 1), January-May, and August-December (Year 2). Table  1 
includes the sample distribution regarding the semester, groups, enrolled students, 
and gender. All students pursue a business career.
This was a voluntary response sampling. During Year 1, a call was launched for 
all faculty members who had previously taught the subject in FIT format to see if 
they wanted to include AL in their course. Those who accepted were trained and 
included in the FIT + adaptive learning experiment; the others were considered as a 
control group. For the experiments of Year 2, a call was launched for faculty mem -
bers who had previously taught the subject in FIT format with adaptive learning and 
who also had a group (the same class) in the face-to-face format. From those who 
accepted, a random selection was made. The selected instructors were included in 
the experiment. In the face-to-face traditional format, they changed their material 
for that of FIT + AL.

Procedure
The course where our study was focused was Statistical Methods for Decision Making,  
which belongs to the first third of t the Business undergraduate program at the Tec -
nologico de Monterrey (Mexico) that has a midterm exam and a final exam, designed 
in a collegial manner. The exams were the same in each of the semesters of the study, 
the questionnaires were multiple-choice to standardize the results and make the anal -
ysis more objective. They include distractors based on the most common errors of the 
students, according to the topic of the question. Both exams are taken in person at 
the Campus in which the student is enrolled. Table  2 shows the characteristics of the 
midterm and final exams.
The final grade also includes activities carried out by students on the CogBooks AL 
platform and other activities carried out in class or outside, individually or collabora -
tively. Table 3  shows the composition of the final evaluation.
The first implementation of the AL courses studied here occurred in the August-
December (Fall) semester of Year 1; four FIT groups participated, two in which AL 
was incorporated and two without AL as the control experiment. In the case of the 
groups where AL was integrated, the students had to carry out reading activities and 
exercises on the CogBooks platform before the class. The platform generates a learn -
ing path for each student according to their initial assessment and progress. Students 
had to cover specific topics before arriving at class. The instructor reviews the pro -
gress of the students in CogBooks before the class with two goals:

(1) To send a message, using the same CogBooks or the REMIND platforms, to the 
students who had not finished the last activities.
(2) To adjust the class to focus specifically on the topics where the students had a weak 
understanding.
According to the above and the results of the CogBooks tests, the instructor designed 
the class considering the scenarios in Table 4.
The students could review the same material on CANVAS in the groups where the AL 
was not incorporated. However, reading it before the class was optional.
The courses contained the same topics in all cases and were addressed simultaneously 
according to the syllabus. Table  5 shows the breakdown of contents and activities car -
ried out in the course, comparing FIT courses with or without AL (August–December 
of Year 1).
In all courses, the instructors who participated in this study are identified with a num -
ber throughout the study (Instructors 1–12).
Considering the results obtained in the first experimental settings, it was decided to 
extend the use of the AL tool to the face-to-face (classroom) modality during the Janu -
ary-May and August-December semesters of Year 2. For these experiments, there were 
eight groups for the first period (four in the FIT and four in face-to-face modalities) and 
twelve groups for the second period (six in FIT and six in face-to-face modality). Both 
types of groups used the same CANVAS course design using CogBooks.
Table  6 shows the breakdown of content and activities carried out in the course, com -
paring the face-to-face courses with AL with the FIT courses with AL in two consecutive 
semesters, Jan-May and Aug-Dec (Year 2).

Data collection and analysis
In the August-December semester of Year 1, the results of the mid-term exam, final 
exam, and the final grades of students who took the FIT course with AL (FIT + AL) 
were compared to those who took the same FIT course without this teaching technique 
(FIT). In the following year semesters, the comparison included students who took the 
FIT course with AL and students who attended the same course in a face-to-face format 
(face-to-face + AL).
The first tool consists of an analysis of the midterm exam, final exam, and final grades, 
as well as the percentage of students passing and scoring above 90. The second tool ana -
lyzes the results of the Student Opinion Survey (SOS) of the instructors who partici -
pated in the study. The SOS included the questions below (Table 7).Table 5 Comparison of the features of the FIT and FIT + AL courses

The SOS uses a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is worst, and 10 is best, except for 
the 08MEJ question which is a dichotomic question (1 = Yes 0 = NO).
It was necessary to verify the normality of the data because its distribution deter -
mines the best way to compare them. We perform Shapiro–Wilks tests to determine if 
the grades’ distribution is normal. The Shapiro–Wilk test is a more appropriate method 
for small sample sizes (< 50 samples). The null hypothesis for both tests states that data 
are taken from the normally distributed population. When  P > 0.05, the null hypothesis 
is accepted, and data are called normally distributed. These tests were included in our 
study (Mishra et al., 2019). Next, inferential statistics with t-student and Mann–Whitney Table 6 Comparison of the characteristics of the Face ‑to‑face AL and FIT + AL courses

U tests were used, which allowed us to contrast the averages of the study groups. Since 
several instructors are involved in the study, an analysis is carried out for the instructors 
who participated in both modalities. Finally, the final evaluation of the students was ana -
lyzed using the Alpha-Cronbach method. The analysis was performed in SPSS version 
25 (Cronbach, 1984; Mishra et al., 2019; Supriyadi et al., 2020).
Results
Quantitative data was collected directly from the CANVAS platform. Table  8 shows 
the results obtained by students enrolled in two groups of a FIT course compared 
with two groups of the same FIT course but with AL (FIT + AL) in the same semester 
(August–December Year 1).
The comparison is made regarding the midterm exam, final exam, and final grades, 
as well as the percentage of students passing and scoring above 90. The average grades 
for the midterm exam, final exam, and final grade of the FIT + AL course were 63.9, 
80.6, and 80.3; in all three cases, the grade point average was higher than the FIT 
course without AL 59.3, 61.4, and 79.9. This can be explained as students need to 
understand the methodology and its advantages. For this reason, the mid-term exam 
results are usually lower than the final ones. An interesting aspect is that even though Table 7 Questions of the SOS survey

the percentage of students approved (with a grade higher than or equal to 70) in the 
FIT course (97%) is higher than the FIT + AL course (89.2%), the percentage of pas -
sers with grades higher than 90/100 is higher in the FIT + AL (24.3%) compared to 
FIT (15.2%).
Table  9 shows the results obtained by the students enrolled in the FIT + AL compared 
with students having the face-to-face format with AL.
The average grade in the midterm exam of the FIT + AL courses was 71, which is 
higher than the face-to-face AL, which is 68.7. However, the final exam average grades 
and the course final grade are higher in the face-to-face AL (70.4 and 83.7) than in the 
FIT AL (59.8 and 77.3). Similarly, the percentage of students approved and those with 
grades above 90 are higher in the face-to-face AL (92.4% and 29.3%) compared to the 
FIT AL (85.7% and 15.5%).
Finally, Table  10 shows the results obtained by the students enrolled in the FIT 
course with AL (FIT + AL) vs. students who enrolled in the same course but in a face-
to-face format (Face-to-face + AL). The comparison is made regarding the midterm 
exam, final exam, and final grades, as well as the percentage of students who passed 
with scores above 90.
The average grades for the midterm exam, final exam, and final grades of the FIT 
AL course were 57.5, 71.4, and 80.8; in the three cases, the grade average was lower 
than the face-to-face AL of 62.8, 77.9, and 84.2. Similarly, the percentage of students 
approved and those with grades above 90 are lower in the FIT AL (90.8% and 18.5%) 
compared to the face-to-face AL (96.1% and 31.8%).
The results of the SOS were also analyzed. This survey is anonymous, applied at the 
end of each period, and its purpose was to detect possible differences between the dif -
ferent modalities of teaching the course. Table  11 shows the results of the SOS of the 
four instructors who participated in the study.
In all cases, 80 to 100% of the enrolled students answered the survey. The results show 
that except for question 2, where instructor I2, who taught the FIT course without AL, 
obtains an assessment similar to that of the instructors of the FIT course with AL, in 
the rest of the questions, the opinion of the students favors instructors who used AL.
The SOSs surveys were applied to students with FIT courses with AL (synchronous 
online sessions), and the results were compared with those from face-to-face courses 
with AL. Table  12 shows the results of the eight instructors participating in the Janu -
ary-May 2019 semester. In all cases, 80 to 100% of the enrolled students answered the 
survey.Table 9 Comparison FIT + AL with Face ‑To‑Face + AL courses from Jan–May (Year 2)

Regarding question 01 MET on the methodology, question 02 PRA on the practical 
application of the concepts, question 04 EVA on the evaluation, and question 05 RET 
on the intellectual challenge, the results show that the three least favorable evalua -
tions are obtained by the instructors I7, I8 and I9 of the face-to-face model. Regarding 
the role of the instructor as a learning guide in question 06 APR, the results obtained 
by instructors in both modalities are very similar. However, in question 03 ASE, 
regarding the interaction with the instructor and the advice received during the learn -
ing process, instructors I2 and I9 of the face-to-face model obtained the three highest 
evaluations. This may mean that students value the closeness of having the instruc -
tor in the classroom. It does not escape our attention that when the same instructor 
(in this case, I2) taught the same course during the same semester in two different 
modalities, FIT and in-person (classroom), both with AL, the opinion of the students 
was consistently better in the classroom than in the FIT mode. Noteworthy, when the 
average of the answers to the 08 MEJ question on all instructors in this period is com -
pared, the AL course is always higher than those taught without AL.
We replicated this same experiment during the following semester. We applied the 
SOS questionnaire to 12 groups; the results are shown in Table 13.
The internal consistency (reliability) of each test or questionnaire should be reported 
and used only if it is high enough; for this, we conducted the Alpha Cronbach study 
(Cronbach, 1984) on the final grade, and the results were 0.779 for the Fall Semester 
of Year 1, 0.7694 for the 2019 Spring Semester and 0.8190 for the 2019 Spring Semes -
ter. These results implied an excellent reliability of the evaluations, according to Fraenkel Table 11 Average results of the SOS survey after having a FIT or a FIT + AL course in August ‑

and Wallen (2006), who stated that the reliability item could be accepted if the alpha is 
within 0.70–0.99.
A descriptive statistical analysis of the scores was performed, followed by Shapiro-
Wilks tests to determine if the distribution of the scores was normal. Next, inferential 
statistics were used with Student’s t-tests and Mann–Whitney U to contrast the aver -
age grades of the study groups. We decided to conduct comparative statistical studies 
between the FIT and FIT + AL groups to determine whether there were significant 
differences. As shown in Fig.  6A, the boxplot shows a higher standard deviation in the 
FIT AL groups in the mid-term exam and the final grade (26 and 10.76) compared to 
the FIT groups (19.9 and 8.52), contrary to what was observed in the final exam where 
the standard deviation (20.26) was lower concerning the FIT groups (23.17).
The analysis of the final score by the Shapiro-Wilks method suggested a signifi -
cant difference between the FIT and FIT + AL courses, with FIT + AL being higher Table 13 Average results of the SOS survey after having a FIT AL or a Classroom AL course in

(Fig.  6A). Since not all the data have a normal distribution, parametric and non-para -
metric statistics were used with students’ t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests to con -
trast the average of FIT vs. FIT + AL grades in the final grade. As shown in Fig.  2A, 
the results aligned with the Shapiro-Wilks method, suggesting a significant difference 
between the FIT and FIT + AL courses (Fig. 6 A).
In the same way, when we compare the grades of the FIT courses with those of the 
classroom courses, we observe that the FIT groups presented higher standard deviation 
in the mid-term exam, final exam, and final grade (20.3, 24.9, and 13.8) concerning the 
face-to-face modality (19.7, 21.4 and 11.6). In Fig.  6B, the boxplot shows that the stand -
ard deviation of the data collected in the FIT groups has a higher dispersion than in 
face-to-face courses. It is noteworthy that there are some outliers. The analysis of the 
final grade by the Shapiro-Wilks method suggested a significant difference between the 
FIT and Face-to-face courses, with the face-to-face course in the classroom being higher 
(Fig.  6B). As in the previous analysis, parametric and non-parametric statistics were 
used with student’s t-tests and Mann–Whitney U tests to contrast the average of FIT 
scores vs. classroom in the final grade. As shown in Fig.  6B, there was a significant differ -
ence between the FIT and classroom courses (Fig. 6B).
Figure  7 summarizes our quantitative data, considering all the averages of the data 
studied. If we take the achievement of a FIT course as 1, the use of AL has positive con -
sequences in the areas studied here: midterm, final exam, final grade, and passing rate. 
However, a significant improvement is observed in the quality of student achievement 
since, in both cases, in classroom + AL and FIT + AL, the percentage of students with 
more than 90 marks was almost 1.5 times higher than in the FIT course without AL.
Discussion
Empirical research on the impact of AL is still limited because the technology for it is 
still developing (Weber, 2019). On the other hand, the complex nature of a subject mat -
ter such as statistics can prove daunting to first-semester students who are still accli -
mating to the demands of higher education. Using AL presents excellent opportunities 
for universities regarding student learning and satisfaction in these and other courses. 
The nature of the systems requires a didactic strategy that allows taking advantage of the 
Fig. 7 Effect of AL in several areas of this study. The averages of the achievement of the students who 
underwent FIT, FIT AL, and in‑ classroom (face ‑to‑face ‑) AL were normalized, considering that 1 is the average 
of all the students who took a FIT course. Midterm, final, grade awarded, passing percentage, and segment 
scores of students exceeding 90 are shown",paper21.pdf,19
"Page 20 of 24 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
benefits of AL in the incorporation of a course. Moreover, the use of AL requires spe -
cialized preparation of teachers in the use of technology and in the instructional design 
of their courses, as well as a scheme to provide continuous support during delivery for 
adequate adoption and implementation (Johnson & Zone, 2018).
In this work, we employed CogBooks, an AL system developed between the years 2015 
and 2020 that stands out among other AL systems because of its size and functionality 
(Osadcha et al., 2021). Nonetheless, there are only a few works that document its use. 
This software has been used previously in biology and physics courses (O’Sullivan et al., 
2020; Youngblood et al., 2022). The authors of these works have empirically and qualita -
tively measured the student’s and faculty’s perceptions of satisfaction.
CogBooks offers nine academic disciplines (agricultural sciences, biological sciences, 
business, health, and well-being, history, mathematics, philosophy, physics, and psychol -
ogy.). However, some users find it difficult to navigate due to too many buttons and links. 
Also, the authors recommend that it could be improved by providing better explanations 
for incorrect answers (Vasyliuk & Lytvyn, 2023). In this work, the CogBooks content was 
curated by an instructional team and adapted to a FIT course or to a traditional face-to-
face statistic for business course.
Regarding the first research question, Using an AL strategy, do students perform bet -
ter (have better grades)? The results showed here that when incorporating CogBooks, 
an AL strategy, in the FIT courses, there is an improvement in the results obtained by 
the students in the midterm, final exams, and even in the final grades. However, there 
was no improvement in the percentage of passed. This may be because of the incorpora -
tion of mandatory activities in CogBooks. If the student did not carry out all the activi -
ties, his/her final grade was affected, and in some cases, could cause him/her to fail the 
course. This did not impact the students of the traditional FIT course because reviewing 
the materials was not mandatory.
Similar studies show positive effects in increase in average and decrease in dropout 
(Daines et al., 2016). According to Wang et al. (2023), students from two provinces of 
China who were randomly chosen to use an AI learning system displayed higher pro -
gress on a mathematics test when compared to those who were assigned to a face-to-
face course taught by an expert. This was irrespective of the group size (Wang et  al., 
2023). A similar result was obtained by Hwang et al. (2020) when comparing the results 
of mathematics tests of an experimental group using an AL strategy with the results of a 
control group. However, in other works, AL technology has been found to be unrelated 
to test scores, but to the students’ satisfaction when used on demand (not as an obliga -
tion of the course) (White et al., 2020).
Regarding the second research question, In what type of course does an AL strategy 
help students perform better? In our work, by incorporating the AL strategy in the 
face-to-face mode, the results, in general, are higher than those obtained in the FIT 
mode with AL; the average in the final exam in person with AL was 10.6% higher 
than the FIT with AL. Likewise, the final grade is higher at 6.4%; the pass rate is bet -
ter at 6.7%, and the percentage of students with grades above 90 increased by 13.8%. 
The results suggest that students are still mainly accustomed to the instructor’s pres -
ence in the classroom. They value and take better advantage of the explanations and 
support given to solve doubts, which could be reflected in their grades. This agrees ",paper21.pdf,20
"Page 21 of 24
 Contrino et al. Smart Learning Environments            (2024) 11:6 
 
with the highest assessment that the students give in the satisfaction survey to the 
face-to-face model with AL concerning the question related to the advice received 
by the instructor during their learning process. Students may find that face-to-face 
counseling is more valuable than distance counseling. In this regard, in a recent 
study conducted by Daugherty et al. (2022), students have expressed concerns over 
the possibility of losing opportunities for social interaction with their peers. To miti -
gate this concern, experts recommend integrating activities that foster collaboration 
among students, whether through in-person or online means, as opposed to rely -
ing solely on software-based solutions. By doing so, students can engage with one 
another, a crucial element in their holistic development (Daugherty et al., 2022).
This takes us to the third research question, Does using an AL teaching strategy 
impact evaluating satisfaction with the learning experience? It is interesting to note 
that in the satisfaction survey, the results on FIT courses with AL were better than 
those without AL and face-to-face courses with AL. This is in agreement with other 
works. For instance, Hooshyar et al. (2021) used a learning satisfaction questionnaire 
to evaluate the students’ satisfaction with an adaptive educational computer game 
AL system developed in-house. They found that students using the adaptive edu -
cational computer game showed a significantly higher level of satisfaction than the 
control group. In other work, learner´s satisfaction levels with personalized learning 
resources were relatively high (93.27% on a scale of 0–100%) (Peng &Fu, 2022).
It is important to note that a statistical analysis was made between instructors who 
taught AL and not AL courses at the same time, and we did not find a clear difference 
between the average of all instructors. This supports the idea that the AL strategy rather 
than the instructor is the critical difference in the student´s achievement. The role and 
the use of AL in undergraduate courses require more research. However, our study 
suggests that using an AL strategy improves the grades and the percentage of passing, 
regardless of the mode of delivery. It also allows the leveling of knowledge of students.
Implications
The use of adaptive learning is very recent, and there is little research on the results 
of its incorporation into the teaching–learning process, as well as the appropriate 
methodology to do so. Adaptive learning technology for education has focused on 
personalized instruction, but not enough on learner satisfaction as a key indicator of 
success (Lim et al., 2022). The ratings and satisfaction levels provided by the learner 
are considered direct feedback, while the scores are considered indirect feedback 
on AL systems usability (Raj & Renumol, 2022). This document contributes to the 
understanding of the use of AL, to the process carried out for its incorporation, and 
to its effect on learning gain and student satisfaction.
On the other hand, in educational systems, we treat all students equally within 
a classroom, mainly because the instructor in isolation does not have the tools to 
provide each student with what they need. Adaptive learning is a tool to personal -
ize learning and provide the student with what they need according to their level of 
knowledge. This article contributed to better knowing and understanding of how to 
personalize learning using AL tools.",paper21.pdf,21

Limitations and future work
We must stress that even though the number of individuals in the sample is acceptable 
for statistical analyses, as in all educational innovation studies, our study has obvious 
limitations, such as the period of study, which is only three semesters, the fact that it is 
focused on a single subject.
The study was carried out in a private university with a high focus on enriching the 
teaching process with the use of educational technology, and with a very specific student 
profile. The results and challenges in incorporating AL may vary when considering the 
tradition of the educational institution in the use of technology, the skills of instructors 
and students in the use of technology, and the willingness of instructors to adjust the 
instructional design and infrastructure of the institution (technology and support for 
instructors and students) (Mirata et al., 2020).
Another limitation is that not all instructors participating in the research necessar -
ily teach the class in the three modalities (FIT, FIT + AL, and face-to-face). That is, an 
instructor could teach in FIT + AI and Face-to-face, but not in FIT without AI. This can 
cause the results to be influenced by the instructor. Moreover, the characteristics of a 
professor in terms of technology management, teaching experience, and predisposition 
to innovation can influence the results of the research.
Furthermore, student characteristics may also play a role. In this case, these are first-
semester students. The results could be different for students in more advanced semes -
ters who already have a higher level of maturity and are more accustomed to self-study. 
Finally, all students took the same quizzes and tests in the courses. This makes it possible 
to compare scores between students and groups of students, but only for the same test. 
We cannot compare tests because the scores do not mean the same thing (they are not 
on the same scale). This is a significant limitation on the research questions we can ask 
within this study design.
In future work we propose to increase the sample to give it greater statistical validity, 
ensuring that it is the same instructor who teaches in the three modalities. Also, include 
the student’s opinion about the use of this technology for learning, as well as the advan -
tages and disadvantages of its use. We may repeat the study with another subject other 
than statistics, too. Finally, we plan to review whether the acceptance of AL depends on 
students’ motivation and self-management capacity. That is, consider these characteris -
tics as moderators of the effect.

"What is Chunki ng Information and How It
Can Make Learning and Memorizing
Long-Lasting in Your Child
by Wright Academics | Oct 3, 2023 | Blog | 0 comments
Parenting a child with ADHD, dyslexia, or executive function challenges can be hard
and overwhelming. At Wright Academics, we have strategies and techniques that can
make a significant difference on your kid’s academic journey. One game-changing
strategy that we use (and we’re going to talk about here today) is called “Chunking
Information.”
Children with ADHD, dyslexia, or executive function struggles can face difficulties
absorbing and retaining information.Long assignments, complex tasks, and
overwhelming study materials can leave them feeling lost and discouraged.
UUaa",paper22.pdf,1
"In this blog post, we’ll explore what chunking information is and how this
technique can make learning and memorizing more manageable and long-
lasting for your child.
What is Chunking?
So, what exactly is chunking information? Chunking refers to an age-old strategy for
memorizing large bits of information. We have been doing this for years! Phone
numbers, credit card numbers, and even initials A-C-E-G,  All Cars Eat Gas. When we
pass information to each other we often chunk it to make it easier to understand.
Think of it as the art of breaking down large pieces of information into smaller,
more manageable “chunks.”Instead of trying to tackle a mountain of information
all at once, your child can focus on bite-sized pieces.
Chunking is the process of grouping bits of information together into bite-sized pieces.
This makes the learning more manageable, and longer lasting.
Parents can help their students use chunking strategies to help them process,
understand, and remember information. As students work on content, and ideas
become increasingly more and more complex, remembering the ideas becomes
increasingly more difficult. Chunking information assists the brain in holding on to
new knowledge and integrating it with what they’ve already learned.
How to implement Chunking? Here’s how to start:
1. Keep paragraphs and passages short. Start a new paragraph when you want
to
introduce a new idea.
Short paragraphs help maintain the reader’s focus and make it easier for them to
follow the flow of the text.
This approach reduces cognitive load, and students stay engaged and
comprehend better the material. It facilitates skimming and scanning, essential
skills for quickly finding relevant information.
Long paragraphs can be overwhelming, causing students to lose track of the main
points. For those with ADHD, maintaining focus becomes an uphill battle. Dyslexic
students might find it challenging to track lines of text smoothly, while those with
executive function struggles may struggle to process extensive information.",paper22.pdf,2
"Blocks of text can appear daunting, while shorter, well-spaced paragraphs invite
students to dive in. The visual aspect plays a significant role in maintaining interest.
2. Use titles to introduce new concepts.
Using titles to introduce new concepts creates a roadmap within the content.
Titles are previews of what’s to come. Students can prepare mentally for the
content they’re about to read. It’s like getting a sneak peek, and that can
significantly enhance comprehension.
3. Use lists and bullet points. Be mindful of how many items or bullet points
are on the list.
Lists and bullet points are an effective way to:
● Break down information into bite-sized, easily digestible portions.
For students with ADHD, dyslexia, or executive function challenges:
● Lists and bullet points ensure that key concepts are shown clearly and explicitly.
4. Use tables and columns when possible.
Tables and columns provide a structured format that makes it easy to organize
information logically. Each cell or column is a designated space for specific data or
concepts.
They break up text monotony, making content visually engaging. This can be
especially helpful for dyslexic students who may benefit from the visual structure.",paper22.pdf,3
"5. Use graphic organizers.
Graphic organizers use visual elements such as shapes, lines, and arrows to
create a logical flow. This makes relationships between concepts, facts, and ideas
more evident, leading to better comprehension.
They allow a clear presentation of hierarchy, showing which ideas are central and
which are supporting. Graphic organizers make it easy to establish connections
between related concepts, and this aids in prioritization and understanding.",paper22.pdf,4
"6. Give instructions in a clear and specific step-by-step format (use visuals if
necessary).
Step-by-step instructions break down complex tasks into a series of
manageable actions.
This sequential guidance simplifies the process and reduces cognitive load. Visual
cues and clear wording make it easier for students to understand and follow
instructions.
Consistent use of clear and visual instructions gives familiarity and builds confidence
in students. Once students become used to this format, they can use it
independently, promoting self-sufficiency and confidence.",paper22.pdf,5
"7. Visual cues and pictures are helpful in showing ‘how’ the information is
chunked.
Abstract concepts, especially those that involve information chunking or
organization, can be perplexing for students.
Visual cues and pictures provide a tangible way to represent the process of chunking
or organizing information. They bring abstract ideas to life and students can grasp
complex concepts more easily when they see a visual representation of how
information is grouped or organized.",paper22.pdf,6
"Additional Information
Some students find it helpful when reading lengthy passages to circle unfamiliar
words and use context clues to help define these words. Look up the meaning of
unfamiliar words. Underline important people and places. Read aloud. Read
multiple times.
Whether your kid is an emerging reader learning phonics, or a college student
studying for a big exam, chunking information strategies can assist you in
retaining important information.
Ready to put these 7 tips into practice? Try applying them in your child’s study
materials or encourage their teachers to do so.
At Wright Academics, we’re dedicated to supporting students with diverse learning
needs. If you have questions or need further guidance, don’t hesitate to reach out.
Together, we can help and empower every student on their path to success.

"Tips for Boosting Focus if You Have ADHD
January 4, 2024 Posted by AANMC Naturopathic Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine Training
In a world that constantly demands attention, staying focused can be a formidable challenge for many.
For those navigating the unique landscape of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
maintaining concentration on studies, work, and daily tasks can feel like a neverending uphill battle.
People with ADHD are also more likely to experience anxiety, which can make focusing on the task at
hand even harder because you may feel anxious about the fact that you are having troubleHome > Naturopathic News > Tips for Boosting Focus if You Have ADHD
SCHOOLS EVENTS STUDENTS RES",paper23.pdf,1
"concentrating. 1 The journey to sustained focus is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a
personalized exploration of strategies and techniques tailored to each individual.
If you are considering applying to ND school and are concerned that your ADHD may get in the way of
your studies, we have compiled a few evidence-supported tips that can help folks with ADHD feel
confident in their ability to manage academic expectations and achieve their goal of becoming a
naturopathic doctor. *Please note this should not replace formal assessment and treatment by a
licensed healthcare professional.
 
Get Organized
Many people with ADHD struggle to keep track of tasks and responsibilities. Finding an organizational
habit that works for you and sticking to it can help make it easier to manage your studies, work, and
personal obligations. Some people like online calendar  systems, while others prefer physical
dayplanners or a combination of both. Try out different systems for tracking your schedule, and see
what works for you. Make daily, weekly, and monthly to-do lists, and use sticky notes (either paper or
virtual) to organize and prioritize your assignments. Learn how to hack into your energy and focus, as
each of us is wired differently.
 
Practice “Chunking”
If you know that your ADHD sometimes causes you to get distracted for long periods of time, factor
that into your planning by breaking projects into multiple “chunks” with separate due dates. This
“chunking” method will look different depending on your personal workflow and the project you are
working on, but here is a simple example of how you could break up a project:
Day 1: Brainstorming due
Day 2: Outline due
Day 3: Paragraphs 1-3 due
Day 4: Paragraphs 4-6 due
Day 5: Edited final draft due
Structuring projects this way can make the information easier to process and reduce the likelihood
that you will become overwhelmed and unable to finish the project on time. 2
SCHOOLS EVENTS STUDENTS RES",paper23.pdf,2
"Wh en making your schedule, try giving yourself a final deadline of a couple of days before an
assignment is actually due so that you have some buffer time built into your plan.
 
Schedule Short Breaks
Try working in a focused way for a set amount of time, then taking a short break and getting back to
your focused work when the set time of your break is up. Research shows that the Pomodoro
technique, where you spend 25 minutes of focused time followed by a 5-minute break, can be a helpful
tool for individuals with ADHD to get work done effectively. 3 Having a set time of 25 minutes to work
followed by a 5-minute break helps to create momentum and increase focus. Also be attentive to the
time of day that is naturally most productive for you, along with the role meals and blood sugar
regulation play in your energy and attentiveness.
 
Move Your Body Mindfully
Research shows that practicing mindful meditation may increase the attention span of those with
ADHD. 4 Mindful movement practices, including yoga and tai chi, can be effective for calming those
with ADHD and improving focus. 5 6 Try integrating a daily mindful movement practice into your
routine by doing ten to twenty minutes of yoga or tai chi in the morning or before bed.
It may also be a good idea to get outside for short walks or exercise when you start to feel your focus
waning. Studies have shown that spending time outdoors in nature can help those with ADHD calm
their minds. 7 Try taking a walk around a nearby park, nature trail, or beach to help clear your mind and
reset.
 
Give Yourself Reminders
Those with ADHD may have a tendency to procrastinate. 8 Giving yourself little reminders can help
reduce the urge to procrastinate and get you back on track. Set alarms on your phone and leave sticky
notes nearby reminding you what you’re supposed to be doing. Having plenty of gentle reminders may
help you shift your focus back  to the task at hand. Setting rules around when you can use social media
or other distractions can limit the number of rabbit holes you go down.

"What is ‘Chunking’?
I had to break the bike rally into chunks. Manageable chunks. And since I didn’t own
a bike, hadn’t ridden one in a decade, was out of shape, overweight and late to start
the training regime, those chunks had to be very , very minute to be manageable.
Especially at the beginning. And later , when the going got tough.
If I had thought logically about whether I could pull this of f I would never have even
begun the training. For starters, the other riders, including my wife,  Ava, had already
been training for 6 weeks. The bike rally was happening in 10 weeks. And this wasn’t
a one day thing. It was six days long. From Toronto to Montreal. It was 622
Kilometers (386 miles) of riding. That’ s roughly from New York to Norfolk V irginia.
From Frisco to L.A. Paris to Amsterdam and then halfway back. And at night, we
camped. That’ s right, camped. In tents we put up ourselves. In various
campgrounds,  one of which was a farmer ’s field.
So on the first day of training, I got on my wife’ s old mountain bike, in the only pair of
shorts I could find. Not flattering. I looked like a potato on two pasty white sticks. And
I rode as far as I could. Which was not nearly as far as I’d hoped. And possibly even
less than I’d feared .  So on that first day of training I rode my heart out… for a
distance of 4.2 kilometers.
I know the distance, because when I finally made it home, I plopped my weary bones
into our car and retraced the route to see how far I had gone. 4.2 kms.  And 4.2 back.
At about half the speed. With a short detour to stop for a cof fee and donut at Tim
Horton’ s. You can find one on almost every corner in Canada because of people like
me.  A total of 9 kms. That’ s less than 6 miles. That’ s nothing! Some people walk that
every day!
How the heck was I going to ride 100 kilometres a day , and then get up and do it
again the next day? 6 days in a row .  Assuming I didn’t pass away that night, which,
at some points during the training, seemed like a great possibility . When I drove back
home and saw the bike, I felt sick. Partly out of the dread of what lay before me. And
partly from the cof fee and doughnut I’d hastily downed trying to replenish my flat-
lined blood sugar .   Panic set in.
Take It One Day at a Time
Until I decided I had to take it one day at a time. Or rather , until Ava assured me I
should just take it one day at a time. So I decided to sleep on it.   Sure enough, the
very next morning, I felt worse. My muscles were sore. My feet were sore. My tush
was sore. And I was sore at myself for telling everyone I was going to do this.",paper24.pdf,1
"So I took the day of f, and spent a great deal of energy working on plausible excuses
and reasons as to why , “I couldn’t possibly do this on such short notice, but for sure I
will next year . After all, I don’t want to leave Ava a widow and the kids without a
father .” The brainstorming paid of f handsomely . I came up with some solid, sensible
excuses, which, if I blurted them out fast enough, would convince anyone I was wise
to stop now .
One More Day of Training Before I Quit
But I had to look good, so I decided that I’d wait and go on one more training ride the
next day , just to show how slowly I’d progress. Unfortunately , a terrible thing
happened. I rode 14 kilometres. I was on a  better bike . With a seat that wasn’t
designed for a girl. And the route was long enough that I “passed by” two Tim
Horton’ s. Oh, and I took a water bottle and drank that too.  
So, I kept training, hoping at some point I’d hit a wall and have to pretend to be
disappointed that I’d have to drop out of the rally . No such luck. Within a week I could
ride 22 kilometres and not develop blisters, cramps or heart failure. Looking back
now, I can see I was very cautious. In three weeks I was up to almost 50 kilometres
at a time. When it hurt, I slowed down, stopped or turned back. And it hurt a lot. I was
astonished. In a month I had muscles. After two months they were very visible
muscles.  
When the date for the rally arrived, I was shocked to discover that I could ride 1 10
kilometres. Though I’d never managed two days in a row , because we kept getting
rained out. Anyway , I made it. The rally began. The first day was about 1 12
kilometres. There were about 190 riders. I think I arrived at the campsite that evening
third last. Out of our group of 20 or so who had trained together there were three
grandmothers! One, Gita, was about 4 feet tall. They had all beat me. But I’d made i t!
The next day was the hottest day of the summer , or so we were told afterwards. W e
had to ride 124 kilometres. The reward was that on the third day of the rally we only
had to ride 50 kms and we got to sleep at student dorm at Queen’ s University in
Kingston, Ontario. A real bed! Yesssss! But first we had to get through day two. It was
brutally hot.
At one point I was the last rider of the rally , with two expert riders pedaling along
slowly behind me. They were called the ‘sweeps’  and their job was to make sure no
one got left behind. So they trailed the last rider . Me. In the late afternoon air I could
hear them talking about their favourite TV shows while I concentrated on not dying.",paper24.pdf,2
"At this point I was alone. Ava had been pulled from the race with heat exhaustion, so
had other riders. It was bizarre. At times I was literally euphoric at what I was
accomplishing. At other times I was in pain, with one leg or the other in a cramp. At
those points I had to ‘chunk it up’.
When I thought about the fact that a lot of better riders than me were being pulled
from the race… that Ava was out for the afternoon… that I was going through 3
bottles of water every 30 minutes… and there was still 2 hours to go… I would decide
it was probably time to quit.
Ready To Quit?  Chunking Helps
So I’d ask myself, “Can I make it another two hours?… Are you kidding, I don’t know
if I can make it to the top of that little hill up ahead.”   
That’ s when I start chunking it up.  “Can I make it to the top of the hill and then decide
if I’m done for the day?” If I stopped a van would pick me and my bike up and whisk
us to the campsite. “Nope, I don’t think I can make it to the top of the hill… How about
to half way up, to that farmer ’s lane?… No, my leg hurts too much… Okay , how about
to the next telephone pole?… Yes. I can pedal that far .” So I did. One more pole. And
then I’d ask, “Can I make it to the next one?… I can make one more… and I’ll use the
other leg and just rub the sore one… Okay , one more telephone pole…
I wonder how far apart they are… Did it…. Hmm, the leg is a bit better , I can do three
more poles and then I’ll decide… the cramp is fading, okay , I can make it to the
farmer ’s lane…” And so I did. The cramp abated, I decided I can handle the next hill
as well… and eventually , I ride into the campground, past dozens of cheering riders,
and fall into Ava’s arms, tears pouring down my face and hers.
Chunking it up.  One telephone pole at a time.  At some points, it was down to one
more turn of the pedal. And one more.  And one more.  Yeah, I can do one more. And
I did. I’ll blog about the other  bike rally strategies  that kept me going next time. In
other words, I’ll chunk this up!

Abstract
Objective:  Children with ADHD frequently demonstrate deficits in working memory and in 
multiple domains of math skills, including underdeveloped problem-solving and computation 
skills. The Baddeley model of working memory posits a multi-component system, including a 
domain-general central executive and two domain-specific subsystems – phonological short-term 
memory and visuospatial short-term memory. Extant literature indicates a strong link between 
neurocognitive deficits in working/short-term memory and math skills; however, the extent to 
which each component of working/short-term memory may account for this relation is unclear.
Method:  The current study was the first to use bifactor-(S·I-1) modeling to examine relations 
between each working/short-term memory subcomponent (i.e., central executive, phonological 
short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory), ADHD symptoms, and math skills in 
a clinically evaluated sample of 186 children ages 8–13 ( Myears=10.40, SD=1.49; 62 girls; 69% 
White/Non-Hispanic).
Results:  Structural equation modeling indicated that all three working/short-term memory 
components exert a significant and approximately equal effect on latent math skills ( β=.29-.50, 
all p<.05) and together explain 56% of the variance in children’s math achievement (R2=.56). 
Exploratory analyses indicated that teacher-reported ADHD inattentive symptoms provided a 
small but significant contribution to predicting latent math skills (ΔR2=.07) and accounted for 24% 
of the central executive/math association.
Conclusions:  These findings suggest that math difficulties in children with ADHD and 
clinically-evaluated children without ADHD are associated, in large part, with their neurocognitive 
vulnerabilities in working/short-term memory and, to a lesser extent, overt ADHD symptoms.

"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder 
that affects approximately 5% of school-aged children ( Polanczyk et al., 2014 ) and is 
characterized by pervasive symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity ( APA, 
2013 ). Children with ADHD frequently demonstrate deficits in working memory (e.g., 
Kofler et al., 2018 ) and in multiple domains of math skills (e.g., DuPaul et al., 2013 ). 
Experimental and longitudinal evidence implicates working memory difficulties as a causal 
mechanism that underlies, in part, ADHD behavioral symptom expression ( Kofler et al., 
2010 ; Rapport et al., 2009 ; Karalunas et al., 2017 ) and difficulties in other academic 
areas such as reading ( Kofler et al., 2019 ). However, the extent to which underdeveloped 
working memory may account for math difficulties in children with ADHD is less clear 
(Martinussen et al., 2005 ; Barry et al., 2002 ; Rogers et al., 2011 ), and the evidence is 
mixed in terms of which specific component(s) of working memory may account for this 
relation (e.g., Rennie et al., 2014 ; Friedman et al., 2018 ). To that end, the current study 
is the first to use a bifactor modeling approach to create latent estimates of each of the 
three primary components of working memory (central executive, visuospatial short-term 
memory, phonological short-term memory; defined below) and examine relations with a 
latent estimate of objectively-assessed math skills (computation, problem-solving, fluency) 
in a relatively large and carefully phenotyped sample of children with and without ADHD.
ADHD and Working Memory
Working memory refers to the active, top-down manipulation of information held in short-
term memory ( Baddeley, 2007 ), supported by mid-lateral prefrontal and interconnected 
networks ( Nee et al., 2013 ; Wager & Smith, 2003 ). Among the diverse models of 
working memory (e.g., Engle et al., 1999 ; Gray et al., 2017 ; Nee et al., 2013 ; Wager 
& Smith, 2003 ), the influential Baddeley (2007)  model has been frequently employed 
to study working memory deficits in ADHD (e.g., Rapport et al., 2008 ), and is 
supported by a strong evidence base in both ADHD/clinical child (e.g., Kofler et al., 
2020 ) and developmental/community samples (e.g., Alloway et al., 2006 ; Smith et al., 
1996 ; Fassbender & Schweitzer, 2006 ). In this model, working memory is viewed as a 
multicomponent system comprised of a domain-general central executive and two domain-
specific subsystems – phonological short-term memory and visuospatial short-term memory. 
The central executive is the “working” component of working memory and is responsible 
for the continuous updating, dual-processing, and serial/temporal ordering of information 
held in the short-term memory subsystems ( Fosco et al., 2020 ). Phonological short-term 
memory is responsible for the temporary storage and maintenance of language-based verbal 
and auditory information, whereas visuospatial short-term memory is responsible for the 
temporary storage and maintenance of non-verbal visual and spatial information. The 
central executive, phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory 
subsystems are functionally independent and anatomically distinct (e.g., Alloway et al., 
2006 ; Fassbender & Schweitzer, 2006 ). A third short-term storage component called the 
episodic buffer was added to the Baddeley (2010)  model more recently, and is used when 
information from multiple modalities must be bound and stored as a unitary episode or 
chunk (e.g., when learning the spatial positions of the phonological letters on a computer 
keyboard). The episodic buffer component was not investigated in the current study; prior Gaye et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper25.pdf,2
"experimental work suggests that the episodic buffer is likely intact in pediatric ADHD 
(Kofler et al., 2017 ; cf. Alderson et al., 2022 ).
Working memory deficits are pervasive in ADHD, with meta-analytic reviews indicating 
large magnitude differences between ADHD and non-ADHD groups ( Kasper et al., 2012 ) 
and recent studies consistently reporting that between 62–85% of children with ADHD 
exhibit working memory deficits when assessed using well-validated working memory tests 
derived from the cognitive literature (e.g., Fosco et al., 2020 ; Karalunas et al., 2017 ; Kofler 
et al., 2019 , 2020 ). While central executive deficits are consistently reported and typically 
large in magnitude (e.g., Raiker et al., 2012 ; Fosco et al., 2020 ), deficits in visuospatial 
short-term memory are frequently reported but tend to be more moderate in magnitude, 
and many if not most recent studies report no evidence of phonological short-term memory 
deficits in children with ADHD based on latent/composite indices (for review, see Kofler et 
al., 2020 ).
Working memory deficits have been associated with the inattentive ( Karalunas et al., 2017 ), 
hyperactive ( Rapport et al., 2009 ), and impulsive ( Raiker, et al., 2012 ) symptoms of ADHD. 
Emerging evidence suggests that these relations may be carried via the central executive 
component of working memory, which predicts both parent- and teacher-reported inattentive 
and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms ( Kofler et al., 2020 ). Experimental and longitudinal 
studies suggest that the link between working memory and ADHD behavior is functional 
if not causal based on evidence that (a) manipulating working memory demands produces 
robust changes in ADHD behavioral symptoms ( Rapport et al., 2009 ; Kofler et al., 2010 ); 
and (b) working memory deficits persist throughout development for most children with 
ADHD and covary over time with ADHD symptom severity ( Karalunas et al., 2017 ; Tillman 
et al., 2011 ; Brocki & Bohlin, 2006 ). ADHD-related deficits in working memory have 
also been implicated in underachievement across multiple academic domains including 
organization and planning difficulties ( Kofler et al., 2018 ), reduced academic success in the 
classroom ( Kofler et al., 2017 ), and academic underachievement in reading ( Friedman et 
al., 2017 ) and writing ( Soto et al., 2021 ) – providing a compelling case for examining links 
between working memory and math for these children as described below ( Rennie et al., 
2014 ; Re et al., 2016 ).
ADHD and Mathematics Skills
ADHD is associated with marked impairments in math ( Loe & Feldman, 2007 ; Biederman 
et al., 1996 ; LeFever et al., 2002 ). An estimated 5–30% of children with ADHD meet 
criteria for math learning disorders ( DuPaul et al., 2013 ). Further, difficulties in math 
are present even in children with ADHD who do not meet formal criteria for a learning 
disorder in mathematics ( Mayes et al., 2000 ; Czamara et al., 2013 ), and these difficulties 
have been documented across all three ADHD symptom presentation specifiers (Inattentive, 
Hyperactive/Impulsive, Combined; Capano et al., 2008 ). In terms of specific math skills, 
children with ADHD demonstrate reduced math problem-solving skills ( Re et al., 2016 ), 
lower conceptual math understanding ( Zentall et al., 1994 ), and difficulties with math 
fluency – one’s skill at quickly and efficiently solving simple arithmetic problems within a 
time limit – when compared to typically developing peers ( Capodieci & Martinussen, 2017 ).Gaye et al. Page 3

"Understanding the mechanisms and processes that underlie these math difficulties is critical 
given their association with adverse outcomes both concurrently and longitudinally. For 
example, children with ADHD who exhibit early academic difficulties in subjects such as 
math are at risk for later academic underachievement ( Daley & Birchwood, 2010 ), greater 
absenteeism and high school dropout ( Barbaresi et al., 2007 ), and decreased likelihood of 
completing a bachelor’s degree ( Mannuzza et al., 1993 ). Myriad factors have been linked 
to math deficits in ADHD, including inattentive symptom severity (e.g., Rogers et al., 
2011 ; Barry at al., 2002 ) and underlying neurocognitive deficits (e.g., Friedman et al., 
2018 ; Martinussen et al., 2005 ). With regard to ADHD symptoms, converging evidence 
suggests that math difficulties may be more strongly associated with inattentive relative to 
hyperactive/impulsive symptoms ( Daley & Birchwood, 2010 ; Tosto et al., 2015 ; Marshall 
et al., 1997 ; cf. Capano et al., 2008 ). In terms of neurocognitive explanations, executive 
functioning in general ( Barry et al., 2002 ) and working memory in particular ( Antonini et 
al., 2016 ; Friedman et al., 2018 ) has emerged as particularly important for understanding the 
math-related difficulties exhibited by children with ADHD as detailed below.
Working Memory and Mathematics
Extant literature suggests that working memory is a significant contributor to math skill 
performance in areas such as counting, magnitude understanding, simple arithmetic, word 
problems, and procedural knowledge ( Xenidou-Dervou et al., 2013 ; De Smedt et al., 2009 ; 
Espy et al., 2004 ; Cragg & Gilmore, 2014 ). Substantial overlap in cortical activation 
during working memory and math tasks suggests a functional relation between these 
processes in neurotypical children ( Metcalf et al., 2013 ; for review, see Menon, 2016 ), and 
provides a compelling basis for unpacking the specific components of working memory that 
drive this association ( Raghubar et al., 2010 ). Within Baddeley’s (2010) multicomponent 
framework, the central executive and two domain-specific short-term memory subsidiary 
systems are hypothesized to play differing roles in mathematical calculation and applied 
problem-solving skills ( Swanson & Fung, 2016 ). While the phonological and visuospatial 
subsystems are responsible for temporarily storing verbal and visual information related to 
math problems, the central executive serves as a general processor that updates information 
in short-term memory ( Re et al., 2016 ), retrieves task relevant information from long term 
memory ( Barrouillet & Lépine, 2005 ), and aids in shifting between mathematical operations 
(Andersson, 2008 ). In support of this conceptualization, Simmons and colleagues (2012) 
found that central executive functioning explained unique variance in addition accuracy, 
while visuospatial short-term memory predicted unique variance in symbolic magnitude 
comparisons and number writing. Similarly, both concurrent and 5-year longitudinal 
evidence indicates that visuospatial short-term memory and central executive working 
memory are strong predictors of math performance, while phonological short-term memory 
is a lesser contributor to non-word-based math problems ( Geary, 2011 ; Bull et al., 2008 ; 
David, 2012 ).
ADHD, Working Memory, and Math Skills
Relatively few studies have concurrently examined working memory and math skills in 
children with ADHD, with the available evidence suggesting working memory-math skill Gaye et al. Page 4
Neuropsychology . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2025 January 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper25.pdf,4
"associations similar to those reported from community/developmental samples ( Rennie et 
al., 2014 ; Rogers et al., 2011 ). Of the few studies that fractionated the working memory 
system, one study reported that visuospatial short-term memory was the strongest predictor 
of a composite math measure, whereas the central executive was a lesser predictor and 
phonological short-term memory did not significantly predict math skills ( Metcalfe et 
al., 2013 ). However, several of the tasks used in that study have been criticized for 
poor construct validity because they were developed to assess gross neuropsychological 
functioning rather than subcomponents of working memory specifically (for reviews, see 
Snyder et al., 2015 ; Wells et al., 2018 ). More recently, Friedman and colleagues (2018) 
addressed this limitation via an elegant study design that included tasks with strong 
psychometric and construct validity support for assessing each component of working 
memory (e.g., Kofler et al., 2020 ; Wells et al., 2018 ), and composite estimation of each 
working memory subcomponent. They found that all three working/short-term memory 
components predicted math computation and applied problem solving, but the extent to 
which each component uniquely predicted math skills remains unclear from that study. 
Despite these methodological refinements, questions regarding working memory and math 
skills in ADHD remain because Friedman et al. (2018)  were limited to a relatively small 
sample of boys, derived estimates using a regression-based approach that has been criticized 
recently for potentially underestimating or mis-estimating the phonological and visuospatial 
short-term memory subsystems ( Gibson et al., 2018 ), and were unable to examine relations 
with math fluency or concurrently assess each working memory subcomponent’s unique 
association with math skills.
Current Study
Taken together, the evidence base at this time indicates well-documented associations 
between ADHD and working memory difficulties ( Karalunas et al., 2017 ; Kofler et al., 
2020 ), ADHD and math difficulties ( DuPaul et al., 2013 ; Czamara et al., 2013 ), and 
working memory and math skills ( Xenidou-Dervou et al., 2013 ; Swanson & Fung, 2016 ). 
However, few clinical child studies have examined the impact of all three working memory 
subcomponents on math skills using well-validated tests. The current study addressed these 
limitations via the use of a battery of well-validated working memory tasks and standardized 
tests of math computation, problem-solving, and fluency skills; recruitment of a relatively 
large and carefully phenotyped sample of boys and girls with and without ADHD; and a 
bifactor (S·I-1) modeling approach that provided latent estimates of each working memory 
subcomponent ( Eid et al., 2017 , 2018 ). We hypothesized that (1) the central executive 
would be a stronger predictor of latent math achievement than either visuospatial short-term 
memory or phonological short-term memory; and (2) ADHD inattentive symptoms would 
predict math performance, both uniquely and in part via shared associations with one or 
more short-term/working memory components.Gaye et al. Page 5

"Method
Transparency and Openness Statement
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions, all manipulations, and all 
measures in the study. Analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling (SEM) 
via the R package lavaan ( Rosseel, 2012 ) as implemented in JASP [0.16.1] ( JASP Team, 
2021 ) with full information maximum likelihood estimation of missing data. The software 
Omega v2 ( Watkins, 2017 ) was used to assess the multidimensionality, construct reliability 
and replicability, and explained common variance of the working memory bifactor model. 
The study’s design and analyses were not publicly preregistered.
Participants
The sample comprised 186 children aged 8–13 years ( M=10.40, SD=1.49; 62 girls) from 
the Southeastern United States recruited through community resources to a university-
based Children’s Learning Clinic (CLC) between 2014 and early 2020. The CLC is a 
research-practitioner training clinic known to the surrounding community for conducting 
developmental and clinical child research and providing pro bono  comprehensive diagnostic 
and psychoeducational services. Its client base consists of children with suspected learning, 
behavioral, or emotional problems, as well as typically developing children (those without 
a suspected psychological disorder) whose parents agreed to have them participate in 
developmental/clinical research studies. Florida State University IRB approval was obtained/
maintained, and all parents and children provided informed consent/assent. Sample ethnicity 
was mixed with 130 White/Non-Hispanic (69.9%), 24 Black (12.9%), 18 multiracial (9.7%), 
13 Hispanic (7.0%) children, and 1 Asian child (0.5%; Table 1). All children/families 
presented with functional English language proficiency and provided informed consent/asset 
in English. All study procedures were conducted in English.
Group Assignment
All children and caregivers completed a detailed, semi-structured clinical interview using 
the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Aged Children 
(K-SADS; Kaufman et al., 1997). The K-SADS (2013 Update) allows differential diagnosis 
according to symptom onset, course, duration, quantity, severity, and impairment in children 
and adolescents based on DSM-5 criteria ( APA, 2013 ), and was supplemented with age- 
and sex-normed parent and teacher ratings from the Behavior Assessment System for 
Children (BASC-2/3; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 2004) and ADHD Rating Scale for DSM-4/5 
(ADHD-RS-4/5; DuPaul et al., 2016 ). A psychoeducational report was provided to parents; 
participating children selected a small toy (<$5) from a prize box.
One hundred and twenty children (36 girls) met all of the following criteria and were 
diagnosed with ADHD based on the comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation: (1) 
DSM-5 diagnosis of ADHD combined (78), inattentive (36), or hyperactive/impulsive 
(6) presentations by the CLC’s directing clinical psychologist and multidisciplinary team 
based on K-SADS and differential diagnosis considering all available clinical information 
indicating onset, course, duration, and severity of ADHD symptoms consistent with the 
ADHD neurodevelopmental syndrome; (2) borderline/clinical elevations on at least one Gaye et al. Page 6

"parent and one teacher ADHD subscale (i.e., > 90th percentile); and (3) current impairment 
based on parent report. Children with any current ADHD presentation specifiers were 
eligible given the instability of ADHD presentations (Lahey et al., 2005; Valo & Tannock, 
2010; Willcutt, 2012).
Our standard assessment battery also included norm-referenced child internalizing disorder 
screeners, and additional standardized measures were administered clinically as needed to 
inform differential diagnosis and accurate assessment of comorbidities (e.g., child clinical 
interviews, additional testing). Several children with ADHD also met criteria for common 
comorbidities based on this comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation, including anxiety 
disorders (58%), oppositional defiant disorder (21%), autism spectrum disorders (14%), 
and depressive disorders (7%). To improve generalizability given that comorbidity is the 
norm rather than the exception for children with ADHD (Wilens et al., 2002), these 
children were retained in the sample. In addition, 20 children with ADHD screened positive 
for specific learning disorders in math (n=12) and/or reading (n=8). Positive screens for 
learning disorders were defined based on scores ≥ 1.5 SD below age-norms on one or more 
KTEA-3 academic skills battery reading and math subtests, as specified in DSM-5 ( APA, 
2013 ). Given the epidemiological evidence for high comorbidity between ADHD and math 
disability ( Capano et al., 2008 ; DuPaul et al., 2013 ; Zentall, 2007 ), and because positive 
screens in the current study were defined based on scores on our primary outcome variables, 
these children were retained to provide a broader range of math scores. Thirty-four (28.3%) 
of the 120 children with ADHD were prescribed psychostimulant medication. Children 
prescribed psychostimulant medication received their usual dose on the psychoeducational 
testing day (i.e., when the math achievement tests were administered). However, medication 
was withheld for ≥24 hours prior to research testing sessions (i.e., when the working 
memory tasks were administered). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the pattern of results 
below was unchanged when ADHD medication status was added as a covariate.
Additionally, 66 children (26 girls) completed the same comprehensive psychoeducational 
assessment and did not meet criteria for ADHD. To control for comorbid diagnoses in the 
ADHD group, participants in this group included both neurotypical children (38.5%) and 
children with anxiety disorders (49%), autism spectrum disorders (37%), and depressive 
disorders (14%). Neurotypical children had normal developmental histories and nonclinical 
parent/teacher ratings, were recruited through community resources, and completed the 
same evaluation as clinically-referred children. Four Non-ADHD children screened positive 
for specific learning disorders in math (n=2) and/or reading (n= 2) based on the criteria 
described above. None of the children presented with gross neurological, sensory, or motor 
impairments that would preclude valid test administration, history of seizure disorder, 
intellectual disability, psychosis, or non-stimulant medication that could not be withheld 
for testing.
Procedure
Working memory testing occurred as part of a larger battery that involved 1–2 sessions of 
approximately 3 hours each. All tasks were counterbalanced across sessions to minimize 
order effects. Children received brief breaks after each task and preset longer breaks every Gaye et al. Page 7

"2–3 tasks to minimize fatigue. Performance was monitored by an examiner at all times, 
who was seated just outside of the testing room (out of the child’s view) to provide a 
structured setting while minimizing performance improvements associated with demand 
characteristics. Math skills were evaluated during a separate 3-hour psychoeducational 
testing session administered according to standard clinical practice protocols. Due to 
the COVID-19 pandemic, testing procedures were modified for the final 8 participants 
according to COVID-19 safety protocols (e.g., face masks, increased physical distancing 
during testing, increased cleaning/sanitation procedures). Sensitivity analyses indicated that 
the pattern and interpretation of results reported below were unchanged with these 8 cases 
excluded.
Measures
Working memory— The Rapport computerized working memory tasks were developed 
to assess working memory based on the Baddeley (2007)  model ( Rapport et al., 2008 ). 
These tasks correctly classify children with vs. without ADHD at similar rates as parent 
and teacher ADHD rating scales ( Tarle et al., 2017 ), and predict ADHD-related impairments 
in objectively-measured activity level ( Rapport et al., 2009 ), attentive behavior ( Kofler et 
al., 2010 ), impulsivity ( Raiker et al., 2012 ), delay aversion ( Patros et al., 2015 ), inhibitory 
control ( Alderson et al., 2010 ), reading comprehension ( Friedman et al., 2017 ), and 
academic, peer, and family dysfunction ( Kofler et al., 2011 , 2016). Evidence for reliability 
and validity includes high internal consistency ( ɑ= .82-.97; Kofler et al., 2018 ), 1–3 week 
test-retest reliability (.76-.90; Sarver et al., 2015 ), and expected magnitude relations with 
criterion working memory complex span ( r=.69) and updating tasks ( r= .61; Wells el al., 
2018 ). Six trials per set size were administered in randomized/unpredictable order (3–6 
stimuli/trial; 1 stimuli/second) as recommended ( Kofler et al., 2017 ). Five practice trials 
were administered before each task (80% correct required). Higher scores indicate better 
performance at each set size for both tasks.
Phonological working memory task.— Children were presented with a series of 
jumbled numbers and one letter that was never presented first or last to minimize primacy/
recency effects. The letter was counterbalanced to appear equally in each of the other 
positions. Children were instructed to recall the numbers from least to greatest and the letter 
last (e.g., 4H62 recalled as 246H).
Visuospatial working memory task.— Children were shown nine squares arranged in 
three offset vertical columns on a computer monitor. A series of 2.5 cm dots (3,4,5, or 6) 
were presented sequentially (1 stimuli/second). No two dots appeared in the same square on 
a given trial. All dots were black except one red dot that was never presented first or last to 
minimize primacy/recency effects. Using a modified keyboard, children were instructed to 
recall the serial position of the black dots and put the red dot last.
Bifactor-(S·I-1) model of working memory.— Bifactor-(S·I-1) modeling was selected 
a priori  given our goal of identifying process-pure, latent estimates of domain-general 
central executive working memory and the domain-specific phonological and visuospatial 
short-term memory subsystems. This decision was informed by the Baddeley (2007) Gaye et al. Page 8

"multicomponent framework, which specifies a single central executive system that operates 
on the structurally and functionally independent phonological and visuospatial short-term 
storage buffers. In this model, shared variance across working memory tests with different 
stimulus modalities (i.e., visuospatial vs. phonological) is attributed to domain-general 
working memory (i.e., the ‘central executive’), whereas variance unique to each task is 
attributable to the phonological and visuospatial short-term memory processes, respectively 
(for review, see Rapport et al., 2008 ). Support for this model includes replicated evidence 
that the phonological and visuospatial storage systems are functionally and anatomically 
distinct, as well as replicated evidence supporting a single, domain-general central 
executive rather than separate central executive components for processing phonological 
and visuospatial information ( Baddeley, 2007 ; Alloway et al., 2006 ; Smith et al., 1996 ).
As recommended by Eid et al. (2018)  and following Kofler et al. (2020) , the current study 
used a bifactor-(S·I-1) structure, such that all 8 indicators (phonological and visuospatial 
set sizes 3, 4, 5, and 6) loaded onto the general factor (i.e., central executive) and a subset 
of indicators also loaded onto each specific short-term memory factor (i.e., visuospatial 
or phonological). As described by Eid et al. (2018) , to properly fit the bifactor model, 
one or more items must load onto the general factor but not onto any specific factor. 
These items are called ‘reference facets’ and define the meaning of the general factor (in 
this case, ‘central executive’). To ensure that the general factor reflected domain-general 
central executive working memory, we selected 2 reference facets: one phonological and one 
visuospatial ( Heinrich et al., 2020 ). We chose set size 3 from each task given Baddeley’s 
(2007)  conceptualization that central executive demands remain relatively constant despite 
increasing set size; increasing set size is viewed as primarily a manipulation of short-term 
memory demands.1 To allow for maximal discrimination between constructs in our bifactor-
(S·I-1) model, the general factor is modeled as uncorrelated with each specific factor ( Eid 
et al., 2018 ), and the specific factors are also modeled as uncorrelated with each other.1 
This representation is based on the underlying assumption that an individual’s score on an 
item reflects at least two distinct sources of variance (i.e., the general factor and the specific 
factor).
Mathematical Skills
Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement (KTEA-3).— The KTEA-3 ( Kaufman & 
Kaufman, 2014 ) was used to assess children’s mathematical skills ( α = .95-.98; 1–2-week 
test-retest = .87-.95). As described below, a latent math variable was created using the 3 
mathematical subtests of the KTEA-3: Math Concepts & Applications, Math Computation, 
and Math Fluency. Math Concepts & Applications  encompasses children’s skill at applying 
mathematical calculation principles to real-life situations. Application skills are measured in 
areas such as number concepts, operation concepts, time, money, measurement, geometry, 
fractions, decimals, data investigation, and higher math concepts. Math Computation 
refers to children’s skill at completing math calculations and is assessed across multiple 
1Please see Kofler et al. (2020)  for evidence from a subset of the current sample that model fit and associations with ADHD 
symptoms were unchanged when different set sizes were selected as reference facets, as well as evidence that (a) the phonological 
and visuospatial short-term memory specific factors were not significantly correlated in exploratory analyses, and (b) allowing them to 
correlate did not significantly improve model fit.Gaye et al. Page 9

"skill domains including counting, number identification, arithmetic operations, fractions, 
decimals, square roots, exponents, and algebra. Math Fluency  refers to children’s skill at 
quickly solving simple arithmetic problems, and is measured by the accuracy of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division problems completed within one minute. Standard 
scores (age norms) for each mathematical skill were obtained by comparison to the 
nationally representative standardization sample ( N= 2,050). Higher scores indicate greater 
achievement.
ADHD Symptoms
ADHD symptom frequency and severity were assessed using the ADHD Rating Scale for 
DSM-IV/5 (ADHD-RS-4/5; DuPaul et al., 2016 ). The ADHD-RS-4/5 includes 18 items 
across two symptom subscales: inattention (9 items) and hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items). 
Psychometric support for this measure includes high internal consistency ( ɑ= 0.94) and 
test-retest reliability ( r= 0.79–0.85; DuPaul et al., 2016 ). Higher scores indicate higher 
quantity and severity of ADHD symptoms.
Intellectual Functioning (IQ) and Socioeconomic Status (SES)
IQ was estimated using the 4-subtest WISC-V Short-Form IQ (V ocabulary, Similarities, 
Matrix Reasoning, Figure Weights), which has a validity coefficient of r = .90 and correlates 
rss = .96 with the full, 7-subtest WISC-V FSIQ ( Sattler et al., 2016 ). SES was estimated 
using the Hollingshead scoring based on caregiver(s)’ occupation and education (Cirino et 
al., 2002).
Data Analysis Overview
Our primary analyses are organized into three analytic tiers. Age, sex, and SES were 
included as covariates in all Tiers/models. In the first Tier, we built the working memory 
measurement model that included a general central executive factor (all 8 task performance 
indicators loading onto a single factor), as well as phonological and visuospatial short-term 
memory specific factors. This measurement model was compared to a 1-factor working 
memory model (all 8 task performance variables loading onto a single factor with no 
short-term memory specific factors) to evaluate model fit. A latent math variable based on 
the three KTEA-3 subtests (Math Concepts & Applications, Math Computation, and Math 
Fluency) was also created/tested in Tier 1.
In Tier 2, we created the primary structural model to test the extent to which each 
short-term/working memory component predicted math performance. Finally, in Tier 3 we 
added continuous estimates of children’s attention problems and hyperactivity/impulsivity as 
intermediate (i.e., conditional) effects between each short-term/working memory component 
and each math outcome. Conditional effects modeling was used in Tier 3 because it 
allowed shared variance among predictors to be parsed according to theory and previous 
research. Pathway directionality was specified a priori  based on the available literature 
reviewed above. Notably, the cross-sectional design precludes testing competing models 
regarding directional effects of working memory and math skills or math skills and ADHD 
symptoms (i.e., reversing arrows does not distinguish plausible models; Thoemmes, 2015 ). 
Inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were included separately based on evidence that Gaye et al. Page 10

"they differentially predict relations between working memory and other ADHD-related 
impairments (e.g., Bunford et al., 2015 ; Kofler et al., 2018 ). Bias-corrected bootstrapping 
with 5,000 resamples was used as recommended (e.g., Preacher et al., 2007 ). For all 
pathways, effects are considered statistically significant if their 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) do not contain zero. Effect ratios for significant indirect effects indicate the proportion 
of the total effect (c pathway) that is conveyed via the indirect pathway (ab; i.e., effect ratio 
= ab/c).
For all confirmatory models, absolute and relative fit were tested. Adequate model 
fit is indicated by CFI and TLI ≥ .90, and RMSEA ≤ .10. The χ2 difference test 
was used to evaluate nested model fit; lower chi-square values indicate the preferred 
model ( Satorra & Bentler, 2010 ). For the working memory bifactor-(S·I-1) measurement 
model, omega total ( ω), omega subscale ( ωs), explained common variance, and the 
percentage of uncontaminated correlations were also computed. Omega total ( ω) and 
omega subscale ( ωs) index the reliability of the general factor (working memory) and 
specific factors (phonological and visuospatial short-term memory) by providing estimates 
of the proportion of variance attributable to sources of common and specific variance, 
respectively; values >.70 are preferred ( Rodriguez et al., 2016b ). Explained common 
variance (ECV) indicates the proportion of reliable variance explained by each factor. The 
percentage of uncontaminated correlations (PUC) is used to assess potential bias from 
forcing unidimensional data into a multidimensional (bifactor) model. When general factor 
ECV > .70 and PUC > .70, bias is considered low and the instrument can be interpreted 
as primarily unidimensional (i.e., the increased complexity of the bifactor structure is likely 
not warranted; Rodriguez et al., 2016a ). Construct replicability (H) values > .80 suggest a 
well-defined latent variable that is more likely to be stable across studies ( Watkins, 2017 ).
All items showed the expected range of scores and were screened for normality (all 
skewness < |2|; all kurtosis < |3|). Delta scaling with maximum likelihood estimation 
with robust standard errors (MLR) was used to handle any non-normality ( Kline, 2016 ). 
Standardized residuals were inspected for magnitude (all positive and ≤ 1, indicating no 
evidence of localized ill fit). Directionality of parameter estimates was inspected.
Power Analysis
A series of Monte Carlo simulations were run using Mplus7 ( Muthén & Muthén, 2012 ) to 
estimate the power of our proposed bifactor models for detecting significant factor loadings 
of the expected magnitude, given a sample size of 186, power (1- β) ≥ .80, α=.05, and 
10,000 simulations per model run. This process compiled the percentage of model runs 
that resulted in statistically significant estimates of model parameters. Standardized factor 
loadings and expected residual variances for observed variables were imputed iteratively to 
delineate the proposed bifactor model. For the Tier 1 analyses, results indicated that our 
measurement model is powered to detect standardized factor loadings ≥ .52, which falls 
well below the loadings for these tasks in previous factor analytic studies (e.g., Kofler et 
al., 2018 ). For the Tier 2 analyses, our structural model is powered to detect associations 
of r ≥.35 between each short-term/working memory component and each math outcome.

(RMSEA=.05) and poor fitting model (RMSEA=.10) at power (1- β) = .92. Thus, the study 
is sufficiently powered to address our primary aims ( Preacher & Coffman, 2006 ).
Results
Preliminary Analysis & Group Differences
All independent and dependent variables were screened for univariate outliers, defined 
by values above or below 3 standard deviations of the within-group mean. This process 
identified 0.28% (ADHD group) and 0.30% (non-ADHD group) of data points, which were 
corrected to the most extreme value 3 SD above or below the within-group mean. Missing 
data rates were low (0.14%) and were addressed using full information maximum likelihood 
estimation. Task data from subsets of the current battery have been reported for subsets of 
the current sample to examine conceptually unrelated hypotheses (please see Groves et al., 
2022 ). Performance data on the study’s primary outcome (KTEA math scores) have not been 
reported for any children in the current sample.
All parent and teacher rated ADHD scales were higher for children with ADHD relative 
to children without ADHD as expected (Table 1). In addition, children with ADHD 
demonstrated impairments on all 8 phonological and visuospatial working memory 
performance variables ( d= 0.49–1.17; all p<.01) and all three math tests ( d= 0.56–0.76; 
all p<.001) relative to children without ADHD. There was no significant evidence to indicate 
differences in SES ( p= .36) or IQ ( p= .05), whereas children with ADHD were slightly 
younger than children without ADHD ( Mage=10.23 vs 10.69, p= .04). As noted above, age, 
sex, and SES were controlled in all analyses. IQ was not included as a covariate based on 
compelling statistical, methodological, and conceptual rationale against covarying IQ when 
investigating cognitive processes in ADHD (Dennis et al., 2009), and because IQ appears 
to reflect, in part, an outcome rather than a cause of working memory abilities (e.g., Engle 
et al., 1999 ). In other words, covarying IQ would preclude conclusions regarding working 
memory by fundamentally changing our primary predictor variables and remove significant 
variance associated with our predictors and outcomes of interest (Dennis et al., 2009).
Tier 1: Measurement Models
Working/short-term memory abilities.— First, we created a 1-factor working memory 
measurement model in which all 8 indicators loaded significantly onto the domain general 
working memory factor ( β = .49- .77, all p <.001). However, this model did not show 
adequate fit (Table 2). Next, we built the working/short-term memory bifactor (S·I-1) model 
by adding the visuospatial and phonological short-term memory specific factors to the 
1-factor measurement model. As shown in Table 2, this model included the domain-general 
central executive (general factor) and the domain-specific phonological short-term memory 
and visuospatial short-term memory factors (specific factors). This model showed excellent 
fit, all indicators loaded significantly onto their hypothesized factors (all p < .001), and 
model fit was significantly improved relative to the 1-factor working memory measurement 
model (Δχ2 [12] = 79.29, p <.001). The proportion of uncontaminated correlations and 
explained common variance were both <.70, supporting the multidimensionality of the data Gaye et al. Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper25.pdf,12
"(PUC=.57, ECV=.68; Rodriquez et al., 2016 ; Watkins, 2017 ). Reliability was high for the 
general factor ( ω=.88) and both specific factors ( ωs=.77–.83). Thus, the working/short-term 
memory bifactor-( S·I-1) model was retained for Tiers 2 and 3.
Math skills.— In Tier 1 we also used scores from the K-TEA-3 math subtests (math 
concepts and applications, math computation, and math fluency) to create the latent math 
performance factor. All three subtests loaded significantly onto the latent math factor ( β = 
.65-.95, all p <.001) and the model demonstrated adequate fit (Table 2).
Tier 2 Primary Analyses: Working Memory and Short-term Memory as Predictors of Math 
Achievement
Next, we created a structural model with the 3 short-term/working memory components 
predicting math skills.2 The model showed excellent fit as shown in Table 2. Results 
indicated that central executive working memory ( β = .50, p < .001), phonological short-
term memory ( β = .45, p < .001), and visuospatial short-term memory ( β = .29, p = 
.03) were all significant predictors of math performance (Figure 1). Together, the model 
explained 56% of the variance in children’s math skills (R2=.56).
Next, we tested a model in which the three regression pathways (i.e., central executive, 
phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory predicting math 
skills) were constrained to be equal and conducted a chi-square difference test to compare 
this model to the primary model above (where the three pathways were allowed to be freely 
estimated). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in model fit between these 
two models (Δ χ2[2]= 1.93, p = .38), suggesting that there is no significant difference in 
the strength of relations between each working/short-term memory component and math 
performance. In other words, all three working/short-term memory components contributed 
significantly and approximately equally in the prediction of children’s math skills.
Tier 3 Exploratory Analyses: ADHD Symptoms as Intermediate Effects Between Short-
term/Working Memory and Math Achievement
Finally, we added teacher-rated inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms as 
intermediate effects between each of the three working/short-term memory components 
and math performance to estimate the extent to which the relations detected are conveyed 
via working memory’s role in regulating behavior. Reporting is truncated for readability. 
Adding ADHD symptoms to the model resulted in a small but significant increase ( p<.001)3 
2Age, sex, and SES were controlled for in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 models as noted above. Older age predicted better developed central 
executive working memory abilities ( β = .43, p <.001), but lower standardized math achievement ( β = −.27, p < .001), consistent with 
evidence that children with ADHD tend to fall further behind their peers academically each year ( Latimer et al. 2003 ; Shultz et al., 
2009). Male sex predicted better developed visuospatial short-term memory abilities ( β = − .26, p = .02). Finally, higher SES predicted 
better developed visuospatial short term memory abilities ( β = .30, p = .01). In contrast, age did not significantly predict phonological 
short-term memory ( p = .07) or visuospatial short-term memory ( p = .08); sex did not significantly predict math achievement ( p = 
.91), central executive working memory abilities ( p = .41), or phonological short-term memory abilities ( p = .16); and SES did not 
significantly predict math achievement ( p = .19), central executive working memory abilities ( p = .94), or phonological short-term 
memory abilities ( p = .05).3Because the models with vs. without ADHD symptoms were not nested, we estimated whether adding ADHD symptoms to the 
model produced a significant increase in model R2 by comparing the model with ADHD symptoms pathways allowed to be freely 
estimated with a nested model in which ADHD symptoms were included but not allowed to predict/be predicted by other variables in 
the model.Gaye et al. Page 13

"in variance accounted (R2=.63 vs. .56), with inattentive ( β = −.29, 95% CI excludes 0.0) 
but not hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (95% CI includes 0.0) uniquely predicting math 
difficulties. Better developed central executive working memory predicted lower inattentive 
(β = −.40, 95% CI excludes 0.0) and hyperactive/impulsive symptom severity ( β = −.24, 
95% CI excludes 0.0). In contrast, neither phonological short-term memory nor visuospatial 
short-term memory were associated with ADHD symptom frequency/severity (95% CIs 
include 0.0). Finally, there was a significant indirect effect of the central executive on math 
performance via the inattentive symptom pathway (ab pathway: β = .12, 95% CI excludes 
0.0, ER = .24), suggesting that 24% of working memory’s association with math skills is 
shared with inattentive symptoms. In contrast, there was no evidence of indirect effects of 
phonological or visuospatial short-term memory on math performance via the inattentive or 
hyperactive/impulsive pathways (ab pathway: 95% CIs include 0.0).
Tier 4: Sensitivity Analyses
Taken together, the primary analyses above suggest that all three working memory 
subcomponents contribute uniquely and approximately equally to the prediction of 
children’s math achievement, with the central executive/math association shared in part 
with the central executive’s role in regulating attention. To probe the robustness of these 
results, we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to determine the extent to which results 
may have been impacted by our a priori  decisions to (1) create a latent math performance 
variable; (2) include children with common comorbidities beyond ADHD in the sample; (3) 
model ADHD symptoms based on teacher report; and (4) maximize variability in predictor 
and outcome scores by including children with and without ADHD in the same model. First, 
we repeated the Tier 2 analyses with the working/short-term memory components predicting 
each math KTEA-3 subtest (math concepts and application, math computation, and math 
fluency) individually, rather than predicting a latent math variable. The pattern, significance, 
and interpretation of results were highly consistent with the primary Tier 2 results, with 
the exception that visuospatial short-term memory was not a significant predictor of math 
computation ( p =.07) despite predicting math concepts/applications and fluency (both p 
<.05). Second, we repeated the primary Tier 2 model two more times: once with overall 
comorbidity (N/Y) included as a covariate, and once with separate covariates for anxiety 
(N/Y) and ASD (N/Y) (depression and ODD were not included due to low cell counts as 
shown in Table 1). Results indicated that the pattern, significance, and interpretation was 
unchanged in both cases, and none of the covariates significantly predicted math or any of 
the WM/STM components (all p>.06).
Next, we repeated the Tier 3 intermediate effects analyses using parent- instead of teacher-
rated ADHD symptoms (parent and teacher reports correlated r=.41 for both inattentive 
and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the current sample). Once again, the pattern, 
significance, and interpretation of results was highly consistent with the primary results 
with three minor exceptions: (1) the central executive did not significantly predict parent-
rated hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (95% CI includes 0.0) despite predicting inattentive 
symptoms (95% CI excludes 0.0); (2) parent-rated inattentive symptoms did not significantly 
predict children’s math skills (95% CI includes 0.0), and (3) the indirect effect of central 
executive working memory on math performance via the inattentive symptom pathway was Gaye et al. Page 14

"no longer significant (95% CI includes 0.0). Importantly, however, the primary finding that 
all three working/short-term memory components significantly predicted math skills was 
unchanged when parent ratings were substituted for teacher ratings (all 95% CIs exclude 
0.0). Finally, we probed the extent to which the findings inform relations between working/
short-term memory and math skills for children with ADHD specifically. This involved 
repeating the primary Tier 2 model one more time, this time including only children 
diagnosed with ADHD ( n=120). The results were highly consistent with the primary 
results reported above, including significant effects of central executive ( β =.49, p =.01), 
phonological short-term memory ( β =.43, p =.02), and visuospatial short-term memory 
(β =.32, p =.02) on math skills, with no significant difference between the constrained/
unconstrained models (Δ χ2 [2] = 2.67, p =.26) indicating that all three components 
significantly and similarly predicted math skills for children with ADHD (R2 = .54).4
Discussion
The present study was the first to apply the bifactor-(S·I-1) modeling technique to examine 
the relations among the three components of the working memory system (central executive, 
phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory), ADHD symptoms, 
and math skills. Additional strengths of the study include the use of a multi-trait, multi-
method, and multi-task design as well as recruitment of a relatively large, clinically 
evaluated, and carefully phenotyped sample. Overall, the current findings indicated that 
all three working/short-term memory components are implicated to similar degrees, and 
collectively account for 56% of the variance in children’s math skills. In addition, we found 
that the central executive/math relation was conveyed in part via their shared association 
with ADHD inattentive symptoms, whereas neither short-term memory subsystem was 
associated with ADHD symptoms.
Of primary interest in the current study was the extent to which specific components of 
the working/short-term memory system were associated with children’s math performance. 
Understanding the nature of these relations is crucial given the high rates of co-occurring 
working memory and math deficits in children with and without ADHD ( Maehler & 
Schuchardt, 2016 ), and has the potential to inform targets for intervention ( Peng et al., 
2016 ). Overall, the findings of this study were highly consistent with developmental 
literature linking children’s working memory abilities and math achievement ( Geary, 2011 ; 
Bull at al., 2008 ) and extend these findings by providing evidence that all three working/
short-term memory components are important for understanding math skill development 
in children with ADHD as well as clinically evaluated children without ADHD. In 
addition, our findings were generally consistent with several studies linking central executive 
processes with math problem solving ( Geary et al., 2012 ) and growth in math ( Jerman et 
al., 2012 ), as well as studies demonstrating unique central executive/math relations above 
and beyond other predictors such as reading and computational knowledge ( Swanson et al., 
4In addition, we conducted a multi-group (ADHD, Non-ADHD) structural equation model to further explore potential differences in 
model estimation between children with and without ADHD. We found that constraining the pathways between groups to be equal 
did not reduce model fit (Δ χ2 [3] = 2.80, p =.42), thus providing further evidence that all three components of working/short-term 
memory predict math performance similarly in children with ADHD as well as clinically evaluated children without ADHD. These 
exploratory findings should be considered preliminary given the relatively small Non-ADHD sample size ( n = 66).Gaye et al. Page 15

"2008 ). Although some researchers have posited that the central executive is more important 
for math problem solving ( Lemaire et al., 1996 ) than phonological and visuospatial short-
term memory ( Swanson, 2006 ), the current study provides evidence that these three short-
term/working memory components are approximately equally important for understanding 
math skills for children with ADHD and potentially for clinically evaluated children more 
generally. This finding is consistent with studies that have reported unique relations between 
all three components and math ( Zheng et al., 2011 ) and extends this evidence base to 
include children with neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD that are associated with 
increased risk for math difficulties ( Friedman et al., 2017 ).
In terms of short-term memory contributions, the findings from this study add to a mixed 
literature suggesting differing strengths of associations between phonological short-term 
memory, visuospatial short-term memory, and math performance (for review, see Frisco-van 
den Bos et al., 2014). For example, some studies report that visuospatial short-term memory 
(along with the central executive) contribute to arithmetic knowledge acquisition and 
math problem solving, highlighting the inherently spatial nature of numerical magnitudes 
(Dehaene et al., 1993 ; Mix & Cheng, 2012 ; Seron et al., 1992 ) and importance of mental 
representations of numbers in space (e.g., mental number line representations) for the 
successful completion of math problems ( Metcalfe et al., 2013 ; Menon 2016 ; Geary, 2011 ). 
Similarly, our findings were generally consistent with evidence linking phonological short-
term memory with the encoding and maintenance of verbal codes that are used during 
operations such as counting and holding partial solutions during mathematical problem 
solving ( Bull et al., 2008 ; Imbo & LeFevre, 2010 ). While some studies have failed to find 
support for a unique relation between phonological short-term memory and math (Furst 
& Hitch, 2000; Gathercole & Pickering, 2000; Simmons et al. 2012 ), our findings are 
consistent with others who suggest that both working memory and short-term memory 
uniquely predict children’s math performance ( Swanson & Kim, 2007 ).
The current study found that all three short-term/working memory subcomponents 
contributed significantly to predicting children’s math performance. This pattern was 
generally consistent with emerging evidence that replicated across two clinical trials 
suggesting that neurocognitive training protocols specifically targeting central executive 
working memory abilities appear to demonstrate efficacy for improving math problem 
solving skills in children with ADHD ( Singh et al., 2022 ). In contrast, at first glance, 
our findings appear inconsistent with meta-analytic evidence that short-term memory 
training protocols generally do not produce far-transfer improvements in children’s math 
performance ( Aksayli et al., 2019 ; Rapport et al., 2013 ). One potential explanation for this 
incongruence may be that extant short-term memory training interventions have been unable 
to produce large enough changes in short-term memory to produce detectable changes in 
math skills.
For instance, short-term memory training produces medium magnitude improvements in 
short-term memory for children with ADHD based on meta-analysis ( d = 0.63; Rapport 
et al., 2013 ). Given the estimated relations between visuospatial/phonological short-term 
memory and math found in the current study ( β=.29-.45), we might expect that a d=0.63 
improvement in short-term memory could correspond with, at best, small improvements Gaye et al. Page 16

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper25.pdf,16
"of d=0.18–0.28 in math that would require a relatively large sample size to detect (see 
Rapport et al., 2013  for discussion of how maximum expected far-transfer treatment effects 
can be estimated by multiplying the magnitude of improvement in the treatment target 
by the relation between the treatment target and outcome). In contrast, central executive 
working memory training has been associated with large magnitude improvements in 
central executive abilities ( d=0.96–1.25 across studies; Kofler et al. 2018 , 2020 ), with 
corresponding expected maximum far-transfer improvements in math based on the current 
study’s central executive/math estimate of d=0.48–0.63 that would be detectable with 
more modest sample sizes. Of course, this hypothesis is speculative given that the current 
study did not assess intervention effects, but is generally consistent with treatment x time 
interaction estimates of far-transfer improvements in math of d=0.56–0.76 following central 
executive training relative to far-transfer math improvements of d=0.15 following short-term 
memory training ( Rapport et al., 2013 ; Singh et al., 2022 ).
Limitations
The current study has several strengths, including a relatively large and clinically evaluated 
sample of children, and the multi-method, multi-informant, and multi-task design. However, 
the following limitations should be considered when interpreting results. First, there were 
minor discrepancies between the exploratory models based on whether we used teacher 
or parent perceptions of children’s ADHD symptoms, which correlated moderately with 
each other ( r=.41) as expected ( Cho et al., 2011 ; Antrop et al., 2002 ; Papageorgiou et al., 
2008 ). This may reflect true differences in the manifestation of ADHD behavioral symptoms 
across contexts (i.e., school vs. home), and the impact of these differences on academic 
performance ( Verhulst et al., 1994 ). Alternatively, this may reflect differences in the 
precision of teacher and parent rated ADHD symptoms, consistent with (a) prior evidence 
that teacher ratings may outperform parent ratings in terms of specificity, sensitivity, and 
overall classification of ADHD ( Tripp et al., 2006 ); and (b) the current findings that teacher 
but not parent ADHD ratings were predictive of children’s math skills. Next, this study 
had a relatively large sample of children with ADHD, which provided a wide range of 
working/short-term memory abilities given the well-documented heterogeneity in executive 
function abilities among children with ADHD (e.g., Kofler et al., 2018 ) that was expected 
to maximize our likelihood of detecting relations between working/short-term memory and 
math. In addition, the inclusion of children with clinical disorders other than ADHD in the 
Non-ADHD group was a strength in that it provided more effective control for the presence 
of these co-occurring conditions in the ADHD group. However, the inclusion of children 
with and without ADHD may reduce the specificity of findings to either population despite 
sensitivity analyses suggesting that the results were robust when examining children with 
ADHD specifically.
Similarly, despite the study’s relatively large sample size and evidence that the ADHD and 
Non-ADHD samples were comparable with regard to race/ethnicity, SES, and maternal 
education level, the majority of the participants in the study identified as White and 
relatively high maternal education levels were reported (i.e., majority of mothers reported 
having a Bachelor’s degree or higher). As such, the findings from the study may not 
generalize to historically-excluded racial minority groups as well as children who have Gaye et al. Page 17

"mothers with relatively lower levels of education. Next, this study was cross-sectional, 
which limits conclusions regarding the direction of relations between our constructs 
(Thoemmes, 2015 ) despite (a) experimental evidence indicating that working memory exerts 
a functional if not causal influence on ADHD behavioral expression ( Kofler et al., 2010 ; 
Rapport et al., 2009 ) and other academic skills such as reading ( Kofler et al., 2019 ); and 
(b) longitudinal evidence that working memory and ADHD symptoms exert a significant 
influence on the development of math skills ( Rennie et al., 2014 ). However, there is some 
evidence that relations between working memory and math skills may be bidirectional (Fuhs 
et al. 2014), and it remains unclear if math performance has a bidirectional relation with 
ADHD behavioral symptoms in the classroom.
Next, a strength of the study was our ability to fractionate the working memory system 
into its component processes based on the Baddeley (2007)  model. Nonetheless, the central 
executive can likely be further fractionated into multiple subprocesses such as continuous 
updating, dual-processing, serial/temporal reordering (Fosco et al., 2019), internal focus 
of attention ( Oberauer & Hein, 2012 ), interference control, and interfacing with long-term 
memory ( Baddeley, 2007 ) with functions that differ somewhat across conceptual models of 
working memory. Future research is needed to determine the extent to which one or more 
of these processes is driving the central executive’s association with math despite evidence 
that it is shared rather than unique subcomponents of the central executive that drive its 
association with ADHD behavioral symptoms (Fosco et al., 2019). Similarly, future studies 
may benefit from including additional tasks that require episodic buffer processes to provide 
a more complete representation of the most recent version of the Baddeley (2017)  working 
memory model, despite recent experimental evidence indicating that the episodic buffer is 
likely intact in most children with ADHD ( Kofler et al., 2017 ; cf. Alderson et al., 2022 ). 
Next, despite the inclusion of practice trials to ensure task comprehension, future research is 
needed to determine the role of language processes in the association between phonological 
short-term memory, ADHD, and math ( Korrel et al., 2017 ). Finally, although short-term/
working memory abilities explained a substantial proportion of the variance in children’s 
math skills (56%), a non-trivial proportion of individual differences in children’s math skills 
remained unexplained (i.e., 44%). To that end, a more complete model of how working 
memory impacts math achievement would benefit from consideration of additional factors 
such as history of math intervention, math anxiety, school climate and quality, reading skills, 
as well as visual attention, cognitive information processing speed, and strategic/conceptual 
thinking – abilities that themselves appear affected by working memory abilities based on 
experimental and longitudinal evidence (e.g., Fosco et al., 2017 ; Kofler et al., 2009; Tourva 
et al., 2016 ). Additional experimental and longitudinal studies in children with ADHD are 
required to further examine these interrelations.
Research and Clinical Implications
Taken together, the current results indicate that central executive working memory, 
phonological short-term memory, and visuospatial short-term memory are significant and 
approximately equal contributors to math skills, and collectively explain 56% of individual 
differences in children’s math performance. Given these relations, assessment of working 
and short-term memory may be informative when screening children who present with Gaye et al. Page 18

"difficulties in math. Current evidence indicates that growth in working memory relates 
to growth in math outcomes ( Fuhs et al., 2005 ), and vice versa ( Raghubar et al., 2010 ), 
suggesting that assessment and intervention in either/both area(s) may prove beneficial for 
promoting growth across domains. In addition, students with working memory difficulties 
may benefit from different types of math interventions than students with average working 
memory ( Fuchs et al., 2013 ), suggesting that working memory abilities may serve as a 
prognostic indicator when developing math intervention plans. While current evidence-based 
interventions for math often target core skills such as computational fluency ( McKevett 
& Codding, 2021 ), instructional review papers have called for more vigorous research 
in the area of effective instructional practices for math ( Hodara, 2011 ), including more 
evidence on the link between executive function training and academic achievement ( Jacob 
& Parkinson, 2015 ). Given the relative inefficacy of ADHD behavioral and medication 
treatments for improving math and other academic outcomes ( Van der Oord et al., 2008 ; 
DuPaul & Eckert, 1997 ; Conners, 2002 ), alternative approaches to targeting math difficulties 
in children with ADHD are clearly warranted. Looking forward, combining evidence-based 
math instruction/intervention with central executive and/or short-term memory training may 
have the potential for additive/augmentative benefits (Chacko, Kofler, & Jarrett, 2014) given 
the large proportion of variance in math skills explained herein and emerging neurocognitive 
intervention evidence reviewed above ( Singh et al., 2022 ). At present, however, direct 
instruction in math skills using evidence-based strategies remains the first-line intervention 
of choice for children with ADHD and math difficulties ( Raggi & Chronis, 2006 ; Jitendra et 
al., 2008 ).

"Key Points
Question:  ADHD is associated with working memory deficits and difficulties with math, 
but which component(s) of working memory contribute to this relation?
Findings:  All three components of working memory predicted math performance 
significantly and approximately equally, and explained over half of the variance in 
children’s math achievement even when controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status, 
and ADHD symptoms.
Importance:  Math skills appear to be approximately equally influenced by central 
executive working memory and both short-term memory subsystems to the same extent 
for children with ADHD as they are for children without ADHD, thus informing potential 
targets for cognitive and academic intervention.
Next Steps:  Experimental and/or longitudinal work is needed to evaluate the potential 
causal relations between working/short-term memory and math performance in children 
with and without ADHD.Gaye et al. Page 27

It has been suggested that diverse interventions applied within children’s everyday contexts have
the potential to improve working memory (WM) and produce transfer to real-world skills butlittle is known about the effectiveness of these approaches. This review aims to examine sys-
tematically the effectiveness of non-computerised interventions with 4–11 year olds to identify:
(i) their effects on WM; (ii) whether benefits extend to near- and far-transfer measures; (iii) ifgains are sustained over time; (iv) the active ingredients; and (v) the optimum dosage. Searcheswere conducted across 12 electronic databases using consistent keywords. Papers were screened
by title and abstract (n= 6212) and judged against pre-defined eligibility criteria (n= 63).
Eighteen papers were included in the review. They used a range of non-computerised WM in-
tervention approaches that included: (i) adapting the environment to reduce WM loads; (ii) direct
WM training with and without strategy instruction; and (iii) training skills which may indirectly
impact on WM (physical activity, phonological awareness, fantastical play and inhibition). Bothdirect training on WM tasks and practicing certain skills that may impact indirectly on WM
(physical activity, fantastical play and inhibition) produced improvements on WM tasks, with
some benefits for near-transfer activities. The common ingredient across effective interventionswas the executive-loaded nature of the trained task i.e., training on a task that taps into atten-tional and processing resources under executive control and not just the storage of information.
Few studies reported dosage effects, measured far-transfer effects (n= 4), or tested the durability
of gains over time (n= 4). The lack of a clear theoretical framework in many of the included
studies resulted in ambiguous predictions about training and transfer effects, and inadequate useof outcome measures. Methodological issues also constrain the strength of the evidence, in-
cluding: small samples sizes; an absence of blinding of participant and outcome assessors; andlack of active control groups. Further well-designed and controlled studies with clear theoretical
underpinnings are required to expand and enhance the evidence base. The heterogeneity of the
interventions and of the study designs (randomised and non-randomised) in the included paperslimited the synthesis of evidence across studies. However, this diversity enabled the identifica-tion of key ingredients, notably the training of executive-loaded WM tasks, which can help inform
novel approaches to WM intervention in everyday contexts.

"Introduction
Speculation that diverse interventions applied within young children’s everyday contexts have the potential to improve their
working memory (WM)1skills and produce transfer to real-world skills such as attention, language and academic attainment has
increased in recent years. However, such approaches have received limited attention to date and questions about their effectiveness
remain unanswered. This review aims to systematically explore the effectiveness of such interventions and discuss whether they may
provide an ecologically valid alternative to the widely adopted computerised WM training approach.
What is working memory?
WM is the ability to hold in mind and mentally manipulate information over short periods in the face of distraction (Allen, Hitch,
& Baddeley, 2009; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Cowan, 2008). The capacity of WM is limited (Broadbent, 1975; Cowan, 2001; Miller,
1956) meaning a finite amount of information can be held and processed in mind at any given time. WM limits the number and types
of tasks we can carry out concurrently, because they are competing for the same limited cognitive resource (Henry, 2012). It develops
more in the first 10 years of life than at any other point across the rest of the lifespan (Alloway & Alloway, 2015a) and reaches adult
capacity levels around the age of 14 years (Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, & Wearing, 2004).
The impact of working memory difficulties in the classroom
WM supports many everyday activities from reading to learning how to use a new device. It underpins many thinking processes
(Henry, 2012), and is strongly linked with attention (Bunting & Cowan, 2005; Cowan, Fristoe, Elliott, Brunner, & Saults, 2006),
language learning (Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998; Weiland, Barata, & Yoshikawa, 2014); mental arithmetic (Cragg,
Richardson, Hubber, Keeble, & Gilmore, 2017); reading development (Kudo, Lussier, & Swanson, 2015; Swanson, Xinhua, & Jerman,
2009); and sensory and motor skills (Alloway & Archibald, 2008; Leonard, Bernardi, Hill, & Henry, 2015). Consequently, poor WM is
associated with a wide range of learning difficulties, including specific language impairment2(Archibald & Gathercole, 2007),
dyslexia and reading difficulties (Jeffries & Everatt, 2003, 2004; Swanson, 2003) and dyscalculia and mathematical learning pro-blems (Geary, Hoard, Byrd-Craven, & DeSoto, 2004; Szucs, Devine, Soltesz, Nobes, & Gabriel, 2013). Children with weak WM skills
have difficulties coping with almost all classroom activities including: remembering and carrying out instructions (Engle, Carullo, &
Collins, 1991; Jaroslawska, Gathercole, Allen, & Holmes, 2016; Jaroslawska, Gathercole, Logie, & Holmes, 2016); problem-solving
(Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng, 2008); and planning, organising and keeping track of tasks (Alloway, Gathercole, Kirkwood, & Elliott,
2009; Gathercole, Alloway, Willis, & Adams, 2006). Teachers frequently describe such children as inattentive and distractible
(Alloway et al., 2009). Children with poor WM struggle to cope with the heavy WM loads of the classroom, leading them to fail to
complete individual learning activities. Over time, these failures result in poor educational progress, as problems accumulate and
affect knowledge across classroom activities. This may explain why WM is one of the best single predictors of a child’s academic
achievement (Alloway & Alloway, 2015a; Alloway et al., 2009; Gathercole & Pickering, 2000; Gathercole et al., 2016).
Models of working memory
There are several theoretical models and accounts of the structure and function of WM. Componential theories assume the WM system
consists of separate stores for the maintenance of different types of information and for executive control (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). Baddeley
and Hitch (1974) multicomponent model of WM (and its subsequent revisions, e.g., Baddeley, 2000) has received considerable empirical
support and been highly influential over the past 40 years. It has been particularly valuable in advancing our understanding of how children
learn and acquire language (e.g. Archibald, 2017; Baddeley et al., 1998; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993; Holmes & Adams, 2006; Swanson, 1994,
2017), which is why it has been used to underpin much of the discussion in this systematic review. Other theories, such as that proposed by
Cowan (2005, 2008), are based on an assumption that WM is an activated portion of long-term memory (LTM) rather than a distinct entity,
and therefore its capacity is related to attentional resources i.e., the current contents of WM are activated representations of LTM.
Although these models have obvious differences, they agree that WM involves two key features: high-level attentional control plus
temporary storage. According to most theories, memory tasks can be differentiated by: (a) simple span tasks that involve the tem-
porary, passive storage of material; and (b) complex span tasks that require the concurrent storage and processing of information and
rely on attentional resources under executive control. The fractionation of simple and complex tasks is supported by evidence that
complex memory span measures are more strongly associated with other higher-order cognitive (executive) functions and language
skills than simple memory span tasks (Engle, 2002; Gathercole et al., 2004; Henry & Botting, 2017). The relationship between
complex span performance and other cognitive and learning abilities suggests that improving executive aspects of WM might lead to
generalised gains across a wide range of skills.

"Research into the effectiveness of WM training
Research into the effectiveness of WM training has stemmed from two (sometimes conflicting) perspectives (Wass, Scerif, &
Johnston, 2012). From a theoretical perspective, the goal has been to understand underlying cognitive processes by exploring the
extent to which training can improve WM and identifying variables that moderate or mediate the effects of training and transfer to
other cognitive functions (Gathercole, Dunning, Holmes, & Norris, 2019; Jaeggi & Buschkuehl, 2014; Schwaighofer, Fischer, &
Bühner, 2015). From an applied perspective, the therapeutic value of WM training lies in its potential to ameliorate problems
associated with poor WM. The focus of applied research has been on investigating the impact of WM training on outcomes relating to
real-world skills such as attention, language and academic attainment. The benefits of practice on the trained activities should
produce improvements both on untrained WM tasks (near-transfer) and on measures of other abilities known to depend on WM, such
as educational outcomes and attention (far-transfer).
Morra and Borella (2015) suggest that WM research has evolved in three waves. The first was fuelled by cumulative evidence that
WM may not be the fixed entity it was once thought to be (e.g., Ericsson & Chase, 1982; Klingberg, Forssberg, & Westerberg, 2002)
but could be altered via training. Most of this evidence was generated through a large number of quasi-experimental studies of theeffects of computerised WM training, the majority of which used the Cogmed Working Memory Training program (Cogmed, 2005).
Perhaps inevitably, this was followed by a second wave in which questions were raised about the methodological quality of the
studies (e.g. lack of randomised controlled trials, failure to blind participants to condition and the absence of adequate control groups
– see Shipstead, Hicks, and Engle (2012) for a comprehensive review). Theoretical questions were also asked about why or how
repeated practice on tasks would improve WM capacity (Janneke et al., 2016; Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Melby-Lervåg, Redick, &
Hulme, 2016; Morrison & Chein, 2012; Sala & Gobet, 2017; Shipstead et al., 2012). The most rigorous studies, meta-analyses and
systematic reviews provide evidence that computerised training leads to gains on the trained tasks and on untrained activities when
the untrained tasks have many features in common with the trained tasks (e.g. Barnett & Ceci, 2002; Gathercole et al., 2019; Noack,
Lövdén, Schmiedek, & Linderberger, 2009; Soveri, Antfolk, Karlsson, Salo, & Laine, 2017; Sprenger et al., 2013; Von Bastian &Oberauer, 2014). Some meta-analyses provide evidence for near-transfer effects, but far-transfer effects are often small and not
sustained over time (Schwaighofer et al., 2015). Taken as a whole, transfer to WM tasks with few overlapping features with the
trained activities is inconsistent (see Gathercole et al., 2019 for a review).
There has been considerable debate in the field of WM research about: (i) the reasons for inconsistent near-transfer effects
following computerised WM training; (ii) the lack of and unsustainability of any far-transfer effects; (iii) the factors that may mediate
and moderate training and transfer effects; and (iv) the potential theoretical mechanisms underpinning these findings (e.g.,
Gathercole et al., 2019). Questions have been asked about the impact of experimental factors (e.g., use of active control conditions,
location and levels of supervision, instructions and feedback, and methods of statistical analysis). The nature of the learning involved
has also been questioned (e.g., whether paradigms support the development of new cognitive routines), and the influence of in-
dividual differences in learner characteristics are increasingly investigated (e.g., age, motivation and pre-existing abilities) (Jaeggi,
Buschkuel, Jonides, & Shah, 2012; Morra & Borella, 2015). However, there is increasing evidence that near-transfer to structurally
dissimilar WM tasks is elusive and that the role of individual differences in mediating these is negligible. Recent studies, taking a
Bayesian approach to statistical analysis to explicitly investigate these questions in young and older adults, found an absence of near
and far-transfer effects following computerised WM training, which could not be explained by individual differences between par-
ticipants (De Simoni & von Bastian, 2018; Guye & von Bastian, 2017).
The third wave of WM research questions the utility of intervention approaches that cannot account for how the underlying
capacity of WM is altered by training (from a theoretical perspective) and do not improve outcomes on real-world skills (from an
applied perspective). In particular, the lack of consistent evidence for far-transfer effects from computerised WM training (Dunning,
Holmes, & Gathercole, 2013; Holmes et al., 2015; Shipstead et al., 2012; Simons et al., 2016) has underscored the need for alternative
intervention approaches. On the basis that gains transfer to activities with overlapping features to the trained tasks, there have been
calls for training to be embedded within the typical activities in children’s everyday contexts in which benefits are needed (e.g.
educational activities that depend on WM) (Dunning & Holmes, 2014; Dunning et al., 2013).
Taking WM training from the experimental setting into everyday contexts has several disadvantages. When interventions are applied
in real-life settings (particularly groups), it is harder to control the training regime including the quality, dose and fidelity of its delivery
(Jaeggi & Buschkuehl, 2014). Extracting individual child performance is also challenging. However, the variation in training tasks and
materials afforded through this approach may be more motivating than computerised training for young children (Wass et al., 2012)
and reduce the frustration they feel as tasks increase in difficulty (Jaeggi et al., 2012). It has been speculated that a diverse range of
activities may impact on WM (Diamond, 2012; Otero, Barker, & Naglieri, 2014) but little is known about their effectiveness.
Rationale and scope of this review
The current review is, to our knowledge, the first to focus specifically on the effectiveness of non-computerised WM interventions
applied within children’s everyday contexts. It is a novel investigation of intervention effects on trained WM skills, on untrained but
similar WM skills (near-transfer effects) and on other untrained, real world skills (far-transfer effects). The review seeks to contribute
to the third wave of WM research by mapping the types of interventions that have been implemented with young children in everyday
contexts and examining the theoretical framework/s used to underpin them (Morra & Borella, 2015). This recognises the need to
considerwhyandhowinterventions are intended to improve WM function. Thus, the questions posed in this review are consistent
with a realist research perspective (Fletcher et al., 2016; Wong, Greenhalgh, Westhorp, & Pawson, 2014). This goes beyond askingA. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23
3",paper26.pdf,3
"‘what works’, to ask ‘for whom it works and under what circumstances’ (Pawson & Tilly, 1997, p. 72) and recognises that all
interventions, whether explicitly stated or not, are based on causal assumptions (Moore & Evans, 2017). The review includes an
examination of intervention intensity (dosage) and which intervention tasks (if any) appear to be the active ingredients i.e., those
attributes of the treatment that play a role in its effects (Hart et al., 2014).
In the case of WM interventions, identifying active ingredients highlights the need to spell out what memory measures really
assess and the skills targeted in training (Morra & Borella, 2015). It is evident that this has not always occurred, or at least that it has
not been clearly articulated. Indeed, the terminology used to describe WM tasks is inconsistent in the literature and the differentiation
between simple span and complex span tasks is often unclear. Short-term memory typically describes simple span tasks (storage-
only). Working memory is an umbrella term describing all memory tasks (simple span and complex span tasks), but can also be used
to describe only complex tasks (storage plus processing).
To avoid confusion, clear operational definitions are essential. Here, the term executive-loaded working memory (ELWM) (Henry,
2012) is used to refer to tasks with an attentional or processing load (e.g. complex span tasks). Short-term memory (STM) describes
storage only tasks (simple span tasks) and working memory (WM) is used as an umbrella term to refer to all memory tasks. Tasks are
also defined by modality i.e., verbal or visuospatial. Thus four aspects of WM are delineated (verbal and visuospatial STM and ELWM)
to categorise trained tasks and outcome measures. Table 1 provides examples of tasks representing each aspect of WM.
Aim
The aim is to examine systematically the effectiveness of non-computerised interventions targeting WM in 4–11 year olds applied
within their everyday contexts.
Research questions
1. What types of WM interventions are implemented and what is their theoretical underpinning?
2. What are the effects of the interventions on WM, and which aspects of WM (if any) are impacted?
3. Do WM gains made (if any) extend to:
(a) Similar untrained WM tasks (near-transfer effects)?
(b) Dissimilar abilities linked with WM i.e., real world skills including language, literacy, numeracy and paying attention in class
(far-transfer effects)?
4. Are WM gains durable over time?
5. What are the active ingredients and the optimum dosage of effective interventions?
Methods
Systematic review protocol
The protocol for this review was reported in line with the PRISMA-P (2015) (Moher et al., 2015) checklist. It was registered with
and published by the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) which is available at https://www.crd.
york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ (Registration number CRD42017056360).
Eligibility criteria
The PICO model (population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) (Booth & Fry-Smith, 2004) was used in the development
of the eligibility criteria for the inclusion of studies.
Population: Studies must have been conducted with children aged 4–11years. This represents the age span of children attending
mainstream primary schools in the United Kingdom (UK). This population is of interest to the review team due to suggestions that
WM interventions applied in everyday contexts may be more ecologically valid and motivating for younger children than compu-
terised training (Jaeggi et al., 2012; Wass et al., 2012). Where participants in a study spanned the age band (4–11 years) but alsoTable 1

"included participants on either side of this range e.g., 7–14 year olds, the age of the majority of participants was considered. Papers
were included if more than 50% of the participants were aged 4–11 years. In the UK, the mainstream school population can include
typically developing children and those with diagnosed or undiagnosed developmental difficulties or intellectual disability. Studies
were therefore not included or excluded on this basis.
Intervention:StudiesmayhaveimplementedanyinterventionthattargetsWMandisappliedwithinchildren’severydaycontexts. Computerised
WM training studies were excluded from the current review as these have been rigorously reviewed and debated previously. Interventions
may have been delivered by a teacher, healthcare professional or researcher and may have been carried out in a school, clinical or research
setting, but must have provided a total duration of more than one session and less than one year of intervention.
Comparison: Studies must have a randomised controlled, quasi-experimental or single case experimental design. While adhering to the
core principles of systematic review methodology in the transparent reporting of study selection, analysis and synthesis, this review
applies realist principles and judiciously includes non-randomised studies (Gough, Thomas, & Oliver, 2012; Pawson, 2006). This is
consistent with: previous systematic reviews/meta-analyses of the topic e.g., Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013), Melby-Lervåg et al.
(2016) and Danielsson, Zottarell, Palmqvist, and Lanfranchi (2015) and the early stage of development of much of the research in this
field whereby even weaker studies may provide information of value (Petticrew, 2015). The risk of bias that this may introduce is
considered and reported transparently.
Outcomes:Studiesmusthaveatleastonepre-andpost-interventionmeasureofWM.Studiesthatinvestigatedtrainingonothertasksthatmay
indirectly impact on WM must also include at least one measure of an aspect of the trained task (s). The primary outcome of interest is the
effect on WM. In order to discern whether the effects on WM can be attributed to the intervention, the trained task must have beenobjectively measured (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). Studies that explicitly taught cognitive strategies to
enhance direct WM training were included regardless of whether they had measured children’s use of the strategies because the use of
strategies is seen as an integral part of the WM intervention. Near- and far-transfer effects and the durability of effects over time are
secondary outcomes, so studies were included regardless of whether these had been measured. Interventions may have the potential to
demonstrate such effects even if these have not been measured yet. The current review will contribute to ongoing debates about transfer
effects and the time-frame within which they may be demonstrable (Redick, Shipstead, Wiemers, Melby-Lervåg, & Hulme, 2015).
Data sources
The search strategy (outlined below) was applied to twelve electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid) Pubmed; EMBASE; CINAHL
Plus; AMED; PsycINFO; Scopus; Educational Resource Information Center (ERIC); Web of Science; British Education Index; Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts (LLBA). The authors also inspected the
reference lists of relevant papers. Where papers could not be directly accessed via these databases authors were contacted directly.
Searches imposed a date limit with studies pre-1974 (when Baddeley and Hitch first proposed the multi-component model) being
excluded. Due to resource constraints, searches were restricted to studies in the English language.
Search strategy
The search strategy was devised through scoping the literature for keywords indexed on published papers, reflection on search
terms used in previous reviews e.g., Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2013), and consultation with the subject-specific librarian at Ulster
University. Following trials of two draft search strategies (January 2017), final searches were conducted (February 2017) with
Boolean phrases using the terms (“working memory” OR “short-term memory” OR “executive function*”) AND child* AND (training
OR intervention*OR treatment OR therap* OR program*). Searches were updated on a regular basis throughout the review and just
prior to its completion (July 2017). The results were exported to Refworks (2.0) and duplicates were removed. An excel spreadsheet
was then created to manage the bibliography of all potential papers.
Study selection
As anticipated, electronic database searches produced a large number of results (n= 6262). This was considered unavoidable as
narrowing the search terms would have excluded relevant studies. The first author screened the results by title and removed studies
which clearly did not meet the criteria (n= 5903). For example, titles which explicitly stated that the intervention implemented was
computerised or that it was conducted with adults were immediately excluded. Where there was any doubt about the eligibility of astudy, it was included for further screening. The abstracts of the remaining studies (n= 359) were screened again by the first author
and this process was checked by the second author. Abstracts frequently provided insufficient detail to support inclusion/exclusionfrom the review and, where there was any uncertainty, the full paper was considered. Following this, all potential papers were
reviewed against a checklist of the eligibility criteria (n= 69) and 50% of these were reviewed independently by two other members
of the review team. The first reviewer compiled a table to aggregate the information on each reviewer’s decision, which was discussed
at a face-to-face meeting of the review team in May 2017 where there was full agreement.
Data extraction
The data extraction process was guided by the PICO framework (Booth & Fry-Smith, 2004). Population, comparison and outcomes
data were extracted from each study and collated on an excel spreadsheet. Data relating to the theoretical underpinning, content andA. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23

"delivery (including dosage) of each intervention were extracted using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication
(TIDieR) Checklist (Hoffmann et al., 2014). When available, data on four variables of intervention dosage were extracted following
definitions proposed by Warren, Fey, and Yoder (2007): (i) dose - the number of properly administrated trials per training session; (ii)
dose frequency – the number of times the dose is provided per day or per week (which may also include session duration); (iii) thetotal intervention duration – the time period over which the intervention is presented e.g., 3 weeks or 6 months (see Warren et al.,
2007) and iv) cumulative intervention intensity i.e., dose × dose frequency × total intervention duration (e.g., 10 trials × 4-timesper week × 12 weeks = 480).
Data analysis
After careful consideration, it was decided that a meta-analysis was not appropriate for this review. This decision was partially
based on the purpose of the review and the research questions posed. The current review aims to map a diverse range of studies to
investigate the best approach to WM intervention for young children. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews advises that
meta-analyses are not indicated for reviews with this focus (Deeks, Higgins, & Altman, 2008). Further, a meta-analysis could be
misleading, given the clinical heterogeneity of the included interventions (Hoffman, 2015). The interventions are diverse in their
approach, content, dosage and outcomes measured so the interpretation of effects in a meta-analysis would be challenging. The low
number of studies in each intervention category would also result in very low power for any sub-group meta-analyses so it would be
difficult to make generalisations from the results (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009)
The data analysis process involved three steps. First, the included studies were categorised according to the type of WM inter-
vention implemented (see results section). Next, the results from each study were examined in respect of: the primary outcomes -
effects on aspects of WM (research objective 2); and the secondary outcomes- near- and far-transfer effects and the durability of
intervention effects over time (research objectives 3 and 4). During this process, all of the trained WM tasks and outcomes were
defined according to which of the four aspects of WM they involved because this was not always clearly identified in the papers. In
the majority of cases, studies did not clearly differentiate between trained and untrained but similar tasks (near-transfer effects) when
reporting outcomes. To be deemed effective, a logical pattern of treatment effects must have been demonstrated. Where an inter-
vention trained other skills to indirectly impact WM, there must have been improvements on the trained task as well as WM (Melby-
Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Redick et al., 2015). Likewise, interventions were considered to have produced far-
transfer effects, if near-transfer effects were observed (Redick et al., 2015). The third step involved extracting the results from those
studies which demonstrated positive treatment effects and synthesizing the evidence for the overall effectiveness of the interventions
on the primary and the secondary outcomes. This enabled consideration of the active ingredients and optimum dosage implemented
in the most effective interventions (research objective 5).
Assessing risk of bias and confidence in cumulative evidence
The external and internal validity of the studies was investigated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of
bias (Higgins & Altman, 2008) which can be applied to both randomised and non-randomised studies (Reeves, Deeks, Higgins, &
Wells, 2008). When considering the strength of the evidence, the criteria suggested by Redick et al. (2015) for the evaluation of WM
training effectiveness were also considered, prompting particular attention to the nature of the control condition. Reporting qualitywas measured using the CONSORT guidance on the reporting of randomised trials (Schulz, Altman, Moher, & for the CONSORT
Group, 2010) and the TREND statement (Des Jalais, Lyles, Crepaz, & the TREND Group, 2004) for non-randomised study designs. The
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology (GRADE) (GRADE working
group, 2004), increasingly recommended for systematic reviews (Shamseer et al., 2015), was used to assess the cumulative strength
of the evidence for the synthesized findings on the primary and secondary outcomes.
Results
Study selection and characteristics
The number of studies screened at each stage of the selection process and the reasons for exclusion are shown in Fig. 1. Most of the
excluded studies (n= 25) were omitted on the basis of the outcomes measured. Eighteen studies have been included in the review
and an overview of their characteristics is provided in Table 2. The studies were carried out in eight countries, with most being
conducted in the United States (n= 5), Italy (n= 5) and the UK (n= 3). Publication dates ranged from 1994 to 2016 and seventeen
were published after the publication of the CONSORT (Schulz et al., 2010) and TREND (Des Jalais et al., 2004) statements. The
majority of studies (n= 12) were conducted with typically developing children, only one study focused on children with WM
difficulties and none specifically targeted children from low socio-economic backgrounds. To be included in the review, studies must
have been conducted with children aged 4–11 years. In the final study selection, participants ranged from 4 to 10 years (mean
age = 7.8 years). Fewer than 50% of the studies (n= 7) were randomised controlled trials, only two studies used an active control
group and none reported having undertaken a power calculation in determining sample size. In terms of outcome measurement,fewer than 50% of the studies (n= 7) measured more than one aspect of WM, and the use of standardised WM measures was limited.
Verbal skills were more frequently measured than visuospatial WM. Few studies measured transfer effects, but more assessed far-
(n= 7) than near-transfer effects (n= 4), with only one study explicitly investigating near-transfer effects using standardised WMA. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23

not require direct intervention with children. Instead, teachers are educated about how to detect children with WM difficulties
and trained in how to adapt learning activities to reduce WM loads for these children. By reducing WM demands in the classroom,
children with poor WM may successfully complete more learning tasks and consequently acquire knowledge across lessons.
(2) Direct WM training without strategy instruction: Three interventions involved repeated practice on verbal or visuospatial tasksTable 2

"requiring STM (storage only tasks) or ELWM (storage plus an additional attentional or processing load).
(3) Direct WM training with strategy instruction: Five studies investigated the effectiveness of explicitly teaching children to use
cognitive strategies while practising WM tasks. The use of strategies to support the efficiency of WM emerges during childhood
e.g., verbal rehearsal (repeating the to-be-remembered information out loud or in your head) develops at about 7 years
(Gathercole, 1998). Other strategies, such as organization and grouping (Bjorkland & Douglas, 1997) and chunking information
(Ottem, Lian, & Karlsen, 2007) develop later than this. It has been suggested that younger children may benefit more from this
strategy-supported direct training than older children who may have established these skills already (St. Clair-Thompson &
Holmes, 2008; St. Clair-Thompson, Stevens, Hunt, & Bolder, 2010).
(4) Training skills that indirectly impact on WM: A wide range of activities including martial arts, physical exercise, yoga, mind-
fulness, music, sports and traditional childhood games can impact on executive function skills including WM (Diamond, 2012;
Otero et al., 2014). Other approaches including sensory-based interventions (Worthen, 2010), proprioceptively demanding ex-
ercise (Alloway & Alloway, 2015b) and motor skills training (Halperin et al., 2015) have also been suggested as benefitting WM.
Nine studies were included that implemented a range of interventions: physical activity (n= 5); phonological awareness (n= 2);
fantastical play (n= 1) and inhibition3(n= 1). Studies investigating sensory-based and mindfulness interventions did not meet
the eligibility criteria for this review.
Table 3 provides the theoretical underpinnings stated in the included papers and the methodological characteristics of each study.
This shows that many of the studies lacked a clear theoretical account of why the intervention should impact WM. In particular, the
studies looking at indirect training of WM through physical activity, fantastical play (Thibodeau, Gilpin, Brown, & Meyer, 2016), or
inhibition (Volckaert & Noël, 2015) did not refer to theoretical models of WM in their study rationale.
Results of individual studies
The main findings of each study and the evidence for each of the four identified intervention approaches are summarised below
(seesupplementary material Table A for a comprehensive overview).
1. Adapting the environment
One paper (Elliott, Gathercole, Alloway, Holmes, & Kirkwood, 2010) investigated the effects of adapting the classroom en-
vironment on children’s WM skills, measuring effects on all four aspects of WM and far-transfer to vocabulary, reading and maths.
Benefits were only reported on the VSSTM measure for one of the cohorts (see Table 3 for details of the study design). The second
phase of the study included observation of whether teachers were using the WM strategies. The study authors reported that there was
a positive association between teachers’ use of strategies and children’s post-intervention reading and spelling scores but that this
association was also seen on pre-intervention measures of reading comprehension, suggesting that the most effective teachers were
already using appropriate strategies prior to the intervention. This review has found no evidence that adapting the classroom en-
vironment in the absence of direct training improves children’s WM.
2. Direct WM training without strategy instruction
All three studies (Banales, Kohnen, & McArthur, 2015; Henry et al., 2014; Passolunghi & Costa, 2016) that implemented a direct WM
training approach without strategy instruction reported improvements on trained WM measures. Between study comparisons revealed that allof the intervention ingredients were ELWM tasks and the training produced greater effects on ELWM outcomes than on STM skills. Evidence
for near- and far-transfer effects was variable. Banales et al. (2015) did not find any transfer from verbal ELWM training to reading skills.
Henry et al. (2014) did find near-transfer effects from trained ELWM tasks to some (but not all) untrained STM skills and to an untrained
ELWM task (counting recall), but far transfer effects to single word reading and maths were absent (although there was some evidence for a
far transfer effect on reading comprehension). Passolunghi and Costa (2016) reported far transfer effects on numeracy skills following training
on all four aspects of WM but they did not measure near-transfer effects. The results here show that non-computerised direct WM trainingproduces positive effects on the trained tasks when these are executive-loaded but the evidence for near- and far-transfer effects is mixed.
3. Direct WM training with strategy instruction
Five studies, all with children between 7 and 9 years of age, implemented direct WM training with strategy instruction. Table 4
gives an overview of the WM aspect(s) trained and the strategies taught in these interventions, showing that two studies trained STM
tasks and three targeted ELWM tasks.
The two studies that targeted STM skills produced limited evidence for positive effects on the trained skills. Caviola, Mammarella,
Cornoldi, and Lucangeli (2009) found that both the experimental and the control groups improved on the trained VSSTM measure but
3Due to the overlapping nature of executive functions, it could be argued that training inhibitory control should be considered as direct WM
training. This study (Warren et al., 2015) was categorised as indirectly targeting WM as the intervention did not involve repeated practice on
memory tasks.A. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23

"there was no significant post-intervention difference between the groups. Comblain (1994) reported improvements on trained VSTM
tasks but there was no clear comparison with a control group. Training on ELWM tasks produced more consistent data. The studies by
Witt (2011) and Cornoldi, Carretti, Drusi, and Tencati (2015) demonstrated significant gains for the experimental groups compared
to their control conditions, although in both cases they were passive controls. Peng and Fuchs (2015) paper was the only study to
compare the effects of WM training with and without strategy use. These two intervention groups were compared to a no-intervention
control group. Neither of their experimental groups made significantly greater gains than the control group on the trained ELWM
tasks and there was no difference between the strategy and the no-strategy groups.
Three studies in this category (Caviola et al., 2009; Witt, 2011; Peng & Fuchs, 2015) measured near-transfer effects. Caviola et al.
(2009) reported improvements on one VSELWM near-transfer task (backward Corsi block tapping task) but did not demonstrate effects
on the trained VSSTM task (see above). Similarly, Peng and Fuchs (2015) measured three untrained WM tasks and saw improvements on
one of these (listening recall, VELWM, where the strategy group outperformed the control group) but not on the trained task. One study,
Witt (2011), found improvements on both the trained task and a near-transfer effect to an ELWM measure (visual patterns task). With
regards to far-transfer, three studies measured a range of academic outcomes and all reported substantial effect sizes: Caviola et al.
(2009) on arithmetical problem solving, and Cornoldi et al. (2015) and Witt (2011) on maths (addition accuracy). However, Caviola
et al. (2009) had not shown effects on the trained task and Cornoldi et al. (2015) had not measured near-transfer effects.
Evidence regarding whether children actually used the taught cognitive strategies was limited with only two studies measuring
strategy use. Cornoldi et al. (2015) directly measured this using a meta-cognitive questionnaire to investigate the effects of training
on children’ strategy use and reported that this significantly increased. Peng and Fuchs (2015) used detailed training logs and also
reported increases in strategy use following training.
Overall, the results of the five studies reviewed in this category suggest that effects on trained WM tasks were observed when
ELWM tasks were trained. There is inadequate evidence regarding near-and far-transfer effects and the impact of strategy-instruction
due to a lack of comprehensive outcome measurement.
4. (a) Training skills which may indirectly impact on WM: physical activity
For the nine studies in which skills that may indirectly impact WM were trained, the effects on the trained task, as well as the WM
outcomes are crucial in determining the effectiveness of the interventions (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016;Redick et al., 2015).
Five studies implemented a physical activity intervention with typically developing children aged 8–10 years. None of these referred
to WM models or cognitive processing frameworks in their rationale; rather they referred to neuro-developmental evidence for the
underlying involvement of the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in both motor and cognitive tasks. Examining the results of these studies
means looking at the exact nature of the trained tasks (ingredients), and in doing so, an important distinction can be drawn between
activities that mostly challenge: (a) physical fitness i.e., they raise the heart rate but require limited attentional resources under ex-
ecutive control because they are already learned skills with a degree of automaticity such as running; and (b) motor planning skills i.e.,
they require considerable executive control due to the novelty of the task, but have low cardiovascular impact such as dribbling a ball
while avoiding obstacles; or (c) both physical fitness and motor planning skills which includes many sports.
All of these interventions appeared to involve novel motor planning tasks. Thus, they have been defined here as executive-loaded
interventions, although in most cases the study authors did not define them in this way or specify the motor planning requirements of
the intervention tasks. For example, Davis et al. (2007) described their intervention as an aerobic exercise program but on closer
inspection of the treatment ingredients, they included the teaching of novel motor skills. This intervention was conducted withoverweight children (n= 94) and found no significant weight reduction. Van der Niet, Smith, Oosterlaan, and Scherder (2016) did
not find any improvements on children’s physical fitness following their intervention, described as a cognitively demanding exerciseprogram and they did not measure the children’s motor skills. Three studies did report significant improvements on the trained
physical activities. Kamijo et al. (2011) reported improvements on physical fitness and Alesi, Bianco, Palma, and Pepi (2016) found
significant improvements on agility following a football intervention. Koutsandréou, Wegner, Niemann, and Budde (2016) was the
only study that directly compared the effects of physical activity with and without an executive skills element. Both groups (car-
diovascular and motor exercise) showed specific improvements from the intervention compared to a no-intervention control group.
Looking at the effects of these physical activity interventions on WM, Davis et al. (2007) found no significant WM gains (though they
report positive effects on other aspects of cognitive functioning). Van der Niet et al. (2016) reported significant improvements on VELWM
(backward digit span task) but not on VSELWM (visual memory span). The study authors suggested improvements in WM skills, in theabsence of enhanced physical fitness, were owed to the cognitively engaging aspect of the trained task. Kamijo et al. (2011) reported mixed
findings on VELWM outcomes depending on the complexity of the task. Alesi et al. (2016) also found mixed effects on WM measures, with
gains observed on a visuospatial STM task, but not on verbal STM or ELWM measures. Koutsandréou et al. (2016) found positive effects on
WM following both the cardiovascular and the motor exercise programs, but to a larger degree from the motor exercise intervention.
To summarise, all of the physical activity interventions reviewed included tasks requiring novel motor planning. Three out of the
five studies reported improvements on these executive-loaded skills. The WM outcomes measured varied greatly between studies and
verbal ELWM skills were measured most frequently. Four out of the five papers reviewed found significant gains on these outcomes.
(b) Training skills which may indirectly impact on WM: phonological awareness
Two studies investigated the effects of training phonological awareness on WM and both used the Baddeley and Hitch (1974) model asA. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23
13",paper26.pdf,13
"their theoretical framework, hypothesising about the role of phonological processing and memory in language learning (see Table 3).
Melby-Lervåg and Hulme (2010) compared the effects of phoneme awareness training, rhyme training and vocabulary training on these
trained skills and on WM (serial recall and free recall). Phoneme awareness training improved phoneme awareness skills, benefitted serial
recall and had a smaller positive effect on free recall. Rhyme training improved rhyme generation skills but had no impact on serial or free
recall. Vocabulary training improved children’s ability to define the trained words. It improved free recall and had a smaller positive effect
on serial recall, but again only for the trained words. Van Kleeck, Gillam, and Hoffman (2006) reported WM outcomes for children with
language impairment (n= 24) who had taken part in an intervention targeting phoneme awareness and rhyme skills (see Van Kleeck,
Gillam, & McFadden, 1998). The original paper reported that children made significant gains from pre- to post-intervention assessment on
rhyme and phoneme awareness tasks, but when comparisons were made with the control group, the gains on rhyme could not be
attributed to the intervention. In the earlier paper, the study authors reported significant pre- to post-intervention improvements on VSTM
measures but in the more recent paper there was no comparison with a control group. When taken together, the results of these two studies
suggest that rhyme and vocabulary training do not improve VSTM skills but phoneme awareness training produced positive effects.
(c) Training skills which may indirectly impact on WM: play and inhibition
Two studies implemented small group interventions with 4–5 year olds. Thibodeau et al. (2016) studied the effects of a fantastical
play intervention and Volckaert and Noël (2015) investigated the effects of training exercises that tapped into four aspects of in-
hibitory control: interruption of an ongoing response; impulsivity control; inhibition of a predominant response; and inhibition of
external factors. Both studies reported significant improvements on the trained tasks (fantastical play and inhibition). Thibodeau
et al. (2016) found positive effects on VSTM and Volckaert and Noël (2015) reported gains on a factor analysis combining three WM
outcomes (VSSTM, VELWM and VSSTM). They also included far-transfer measures of children’s externalising behaviours and re-
ported significant effects including a reduction in children’s negative and inattentive behaviours. The study authors suggested that a
meta-cognitive element to the intervention may have supported transfer to attention behaviours. To summarise, these studies suggest
that children’s fantastical play skills can be improved by intervention and that this can strengthen VSTM skills. Inhibitory control was
improved by training and produced effects on WM, attention and behaviour.
Synthesized findings; active ingredients, dosage, transfer effects and maintenance
The current section provides a synthesis of the results for: the primary outcomes (effects on trained aspects of WM, research
objective 2); the secondary outcomes (near- and far-transfer effects, research objective 3); and durability over time (research objective
4).Table 5 presents the intervention ingredients extracted from those studies deemed to be effective, following the criteria outlined in
the data analysis section.4The key finding is clearly demonstrated - in all of the effective interventions, the trained tasks were executive-
loaded. Overall, the evidence for near- and far-transfer effects from WM interventions within the child’s environment was limited to
three studies (see Table 5: Henry et al., 2014; Volckaert & Noël, 2015; Witt, 2011), although the evidence was constrained by the lack of
near-transfer effects being measured in some studies. For example, Peng and Fuchs (2015), Cornoldi et al. (2015) and Passolunghi andTable 4

"Costa (2016) reported significant far transfer effects following training, but had not measured near-transfer effects.
There was less consistency regarding the findings on intervention dosage. When they were reported, there was considerable
variation between studies. Dose/number of trials per intervention session was only reported in one paper (Henry et al., 2014). Despite
this, Table 5 demonstrates that training effects can be observed following relatively short interventions of 5–8 weeks (albeit with
varying intensity of sessions per week) (see Appendix A for full details).
The fourth research objective was to identify whether WM gains were durable over time. Only four of the included studies
(Banales et al., 2015; Henry et al., 2014; Cornoldi et al., 2015; Comblain, 1994) included any follow-up period so the evidence here islimited. These studies were heterogeneous in their intervention approaches and in the length of time between post-intervention
assessment and follow up but all demonstrated that WM gains had been maintained.
Risk of bias
The risk of bias in the included studies is significant due to methodological issues (see completed Cochrane risk of bias tool,
Appendix B). Fewer than 50% of included studies were randomised controlled trials (n= 8) and none of the studies reported un-
dertaking a power analysis, so small sample sizes may have resulted in inflated effects being reported (Button et al., 2013). Whether
the children’s teachers were aware of the purpose of the intervention was often unclear and without clear audit protocols being put in
place this raises questions about the fidelity of implementation. There was also a lack of active control groups and blinding, which are
important in WM research studies, especially with children whose familiarity with experimenters could affect their motivation and
outcomes (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013; Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016; Redick et al., 2015). Reporting issues were also identified by the
CONSORT (Schulz et al., 2010) and TREND (Des Jalais et al., 2004) checklists especially in relation to randomisation and allocation
processes which were consistently unreported. Publication bias may also threaten the validity of the findings because, although the
grey literature was comprehensively searched, only published papers met the review criteria. On balance, the review findings for the
effectiveness of non-computerised WM interventions in children’s everyday contexts should be considered as suggestive evidence and
viewed with some caution until further evidence is obtained from more robust studies.
Discussion
The aim of this review was to examine systematically the effectiveness of interventions targeting WM in 4–11 year olds applied
within their everyday contexts. The first research objective was to identify both the types of WM interventions implemented and their
theoretical underpinnings. A systematic search of the literature resulted in eighteen studies being reviewed, encompassing a range of
intervention approaches including: adapting the environment to reduce WM loads; direct WM training without strategy instruction;
direct WM training with strategy instruction; and training skills that may indirectly impact on WM (physical activity, phonological
awareness, fantastical play and inhibition). Many of the included studies lacked a clear theoretical account of why the intervention
should impact WM. In particular, the studies looking at indirect training of WM through physical activity, fantastical play (Thibodeau
et al., 2016), or inhibition (Volckaert & Noël, 2015) were not explicitly underpinned by theoretical models of WM.
The second research question was to identify the effects of interventions targeting WM in children’s everyday contexts on each
aspect of WM. Answering this question was challenging because in the majority of studies, the aspect of WM being trained or measured
was not elucidated, and there was often no clear distinction between STM and ELWM tasks. Nonetheless, a significant outcome of this
review is that WM skills can be altered through diverse interventions, particularly in relation to verbal WM skills which were more
frequently measured than the visuospatial domain. ELWM skills appear to be more amenable to change than STM skills.
The third and fourth research questions were to identify any near-and far-transfer effects and the durability of WM gains over
time. The evidence here was limited because few studies measured these outcomes. However, there is preliminary evidence sug-
gesting that certain direct and indirect WM tasks applied within children’s everyday contexts have the potential to produce: near-
transfer effects on similar WM tasks (Henry et al., 2014; Witt, 2011); and far-transfer effects on areas such as reading comprehension
(Henry et al., 2014), numeracy skills (Witt, 2011), attention and behaviour (Volckaert & Noël, 2015).
Reflection on the potential of these varied interventions to produce training and transfer effects leads to questions about which children
may benefit most and the impact of individual differences. The age of participants varied within each intervention type, making it difficult
to draw strong conclusions about age effects. A number of the interventions reviewed showed significant benefits for younger children
(4–5 year olds) (Passolunghi & Costa, 2016; Thibodeau et al., 2016; Van Kleeck et al., 2006; Volckaert & Noël, 2015), reinforcing the idea
that non-computerised approaches might be more suitable for younger children. The majority of studies were with typically developing
children, meaning it was not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions for children with identified WM difficulties,
neurodevelopmental difficulties or at-risk groups such as those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds persist. Nonetheless, it would be
beneficial in future reviews to evaluate the effects of differences in baseline abilities and other individual differences.
The final research question concerned the active ingredients and optimum dosage requirements for WM interventions applied in
children’s everyday contexts. Here the synthesized data from those studies demonstrating effects on WM indicated that the most
effective tasks were executive-loaded i.e., they tap into attentional resources under executive control. The effective ELWM tasks were:
listening recall, odd one out, backward digit recall, verbal and visuospatial dual tasks, and word list updating. When considering
indirect WM tasks, there is suggestive evidence that cognitively-demanding physical activity (motor planning), fantastical play
(Thibodeau et al., 2016) and inhibition training (Volckaert & Noël, 2015) are beneficial to ELWM. In these effective interventions, it
is perhaps the overlapping nature of the trained activities, WM and real-world skills that is the active ingredient resulting in pro-
mising positive effects (Gathercole et al., 2018).A. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23

"The optimum dosage required to produce training effects remains uncertain because dosage variables were often unreported or
showed significant variation across studies. However, relatively short interventions of 5–6 weeks in total duration (albeit with dif-
ferent frequency of sessions) were shown to be effective (e.g., Henry et al., 2014; Thibodeau et al., 2016; Volckaert & Noël, 2015).
There is still a great deal to learn about optimal levels of dosage for interventions in the area of child language and development(Justice, 2018). Clearly, this is an area requiring more detail and rigour in intervention studies to better inform our understanding of
dosage and increase applicability of interventions to clinical contexts (Sugden, Baker, Munro, Williams, & Trivette, 2018).
Limitations
Several methodological factors may limit confidence in the findings of this review, including the risk of bias in individual studies
due to the frequent lack of control of confounding variables, small samples sizes and an absence of blinding of participant and
outcome assessors. Only two of the included studies incorporated active control groups in their design. This highlights a significant
weakness that has also impacted on empirical research into computerised WM training (Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013). The lack of an
active control group means that training effects could be attributed to other variables that differ between experimental and passive
control groups (Redick et al., 2015).
The absence of a clear theoretical framework in many of the included studies has limited the evidence found in this review. The
lack of a sound theoretical underpinning leads to ambiguous predictions and unclear conclusions about training effects, which then
impact on outcome measurement. The distinction between STM and ELWM tasks is widely accepted across both componential and
attentional models of WM (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Baddeley, 2000; Cowan, 2005). However, in many studies the trained tasks and
outcomes measured were not clearly defined. For example, none of the physical activity studies measured VSELWM which, given
Baddeley (2000, 2007) hypothesis that kinaesthetic memory is managed within the visuospatial sketchpad, may also be expected to
show associations with motor planning. Unspecified causal pathways also resulted in near-transfer effects being measured inad-
vertently or, in many cases, not measured at all. The lack of recognition of near-transfer effects subsequently impacts on conclusions
about far-transfer. It is difficult to attribute far-transfer effects to interventions if near-transfer effects have not been demonstrated
(Redick et al., 2015). Only one study explicitly recognised this (Henry et al., 2014), with three others measuring far-transfer effects
without measuring near-transfer (Banales et al., 2015; Cornoldi et al., 2015; Passolunghi & Costa, 2016).
The clinical diversity of the included interventions is both a limitation and a strength of this review. The heterogeneity of the
interventions implemented and the study design (randomised and non-randomised) means that a meta-analysis was not appropriate
in this review. This may have limited the strength of the evidence presented but synthesizing study effects in a meta-analysis would
have produced misleading findings. The diverse nature of the interventions reviewed has enabled the identification of key in-
gredients, notably training ELWM, as well as developing recommendations that can help inform novel methodologies (Reeves et al.,
2008) and significantly enhance thinking to support the third wave of WM research (Morra & Borella, 2015).
Future directions
From both theoretical and applied perspectives, many questions about the utility of WM training approaches remain unanswered.
We must therefore consider whether it is overly optimistic to continue developing and testing diverse, WM intervention approaches with
the aim of impacting on real world skills, and indeed whether this is a worthy goal for applied research. This review provides suggestive
evidence for the effectiveness of diverse WM interventions applied within children’s everyday context, when the trained tasks are
executive-loaded. Evidence has emerged of what might be possible and there are several advantages to the types of interventions
reviewed here in comparison to computerised WM training. These include: greater flexibility in how the tasks are presented; less of a
requirement for young children to sit still for long periods of time; and opportunities to promote social and emotional development in
activities embedded within the child’s own environment (Diamond & Lee, 2011) (which may be appealing to education practitioners). It
has also been speculated that young children may not be motivated by this approach (Jaeggi et al., 2012; Wass et al., 2012).
The considerable challenges of conducting further research in applied settings must also be acknowledged. Although compu-
terised WM training lacks the ecological validity of WM interventions provided within the child’s everyday context, it allows for
tighter control over both the training environment and paradigms. The manipulation of WM loads on a trial-by-trial basis may be
important for improving WM (Klingberg, 2010), and this is easier with computerised programmes. Ensuring that children are
working at capacity is much harder to achieve in real-life contexts, particularly when working with groups. Conversely, there is some
evidence to suggest that the incremental increases automatically prescribed during computerised training can be too great, thereby
lessening children’s motivation (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Shah, 2011). Controlling the level of distraction in the environment is
also difficult in non-laboratory training environments. However, the occurrence of distraction alongside training may indeed enhance
its ecological validity and support transfer effects (De Simoni & von Bastian, 2018). Of course, it may eventually be possible to
develop a hybrid intervention approach that integrates the benefits of computerised training in everyday contexts. There may be
potential for the utilisation of technology to monitor children’s responses and continually adapt the difficulty level of training trials
delivered face-to-face. For example, education professionals could deliver practice trials on ELWM tasks in schools and record re-
sponses on a portable device (laptop or tablet) with software informing the facilitator about levels of difficulty.
The strength of evidence found in this review is compromised by inter-related theoretical and methodological issues, a lack of
clear empirical evidence does not necessarily equate to ineffectiveness and says nothing about the potential for future interventions
(Shipstead et al., 2012). In future research, there needs to be greater recognition that all interventions are based on causal as-
sumptions (Moore & Evans, 2017). Future studies need to present a clear theoretical account of how and why the intervention shouldA. Rowe, et al. Developmental Review 52 (2019) 1–23
17",paper26.pdf,17
"impact WM in hypothesis-driven research. It will be important also to apply greater rigour in study methodology, including the use of
active control groups and randomised controlled designs. In order to develop a greater understanding of the relationship between
intervention ingredients, WM outcomes and real world skills, outcome measurement must be comprehensive. Greater attention must
also be paid to intervention dosage. There is a need to look more closely within interventions, to distil them and identify exactly
which ingredients and dosages act as optimal mechanisms of change. This will require replicating specific tasks or subgroups of tasks
embedded in successful interventions and varying the doses delivered in treatment sessions, frequency of intervention sessions, and
overall duration of intervention in comparative studies (Warren et al., 2007).
Clarifying for whom non-computerized WM interventions may be most effective, and in what circumstances, should be a goal of
further research. Future studies should target children from understudied sub-groups such as those with identified WM difficulties,
neurodevelopmental difficulties or at-risk groups such as those from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Greater consideration should
be given to the role of individual differences that could influence the effectiveness of interventions e.g., cognitive level, motivation
(Melby-Lervåg et al., 2016). It may also be pertinent to consider the context in which the intervention is implemented such as the
influence of the child’s environment (Hawe, 2015; McLeroy, Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1988).
Conclusions
Diverse interventions applied within young children’s everyday contexts, have produced improvements on their WM skills and
have the potential to produce near- and far-transfer effects. Both direct training on WM tasks and practicing certain skills that may
indirectly impact on WM (physical activity, fantastical play and inhibition) were beneficial. The common ingredient across effective
interventions was the executive-loaded nature of the trained task i.e., training on a task that taps into attentional and processing
resources under executive control not just the storage of information. The strength of the evidence is tempered by a lack of clear
theoretical underpinnings, rigorous methodology and consideration of dosage. Further well-designed and controlled studies with
sound theoretical underpinnings and comprehensive outcome measurement, comparing carefully-considered dosages, are required to
expand and enhance the evidence base.

Both adults and children –by the time they are 2–3 years old– have a general ability
to recode information to increase memory efﬁciency. This paper aims to evaluate the
ability of untrained children aged 6–10 years old to deploy such a recoding process in
immediatememory.Alargesampleof374childrenweregivenataskofimmediateserial
report based on SIMON/circleR, a classic memory game made of four colored buttons (red,
green, yellow, blue) requiring players to reproduce a sequence of colors within which
repetitions eventually occur. It was hypothesized that a primitive ability across all ages
(since theoretically already available in toddlers) to detect redundancies allows the span
to increase whenever information can be recoded on the ﬂy. The chunkable condition
prompted the formation of chunks based on the perceived structure of color repetition
withinto-be-recalledsequencesofcolors.Ourresultshowsasimilarlinearimprovement
ofmemoryspanwithageforbothchunkableandnon-chunkableconditions.Theamount
of information retained in immediate memory systematically increased for the groupable
sequences across all age groups, independently of the average age-group span that
was measured on sequences that contained fewer repetitions. This result shows that
chunking gives young children an equal beneﬁt as older children. We discuss the role of
recodingintheexpansionofcapacityinimmediatememoryandthepotentialroleofdata
compression in the formation of chunks in long-term memory.

A recoding process involves dividing an apparent arbitrary input into meaningful groups. The
ability to recode rapidly inputs made of identical constituents (000.111), regular series (123.321)
orknownmaterial(e.g.,25.12.1986,yourfavoriteChristmasyear)haslongbeenstudiedtoaccount
for the recall of information over short intervals ( Miller, 1956, 1958; Bower and Winzenz, 1969;
B
or and Owen, 2007; Farrell, 2012; Mathy and Feldman, 2012; Mathy and Varré, 2013). Although
t
his ability to chunk inputs has been thought to alleviate capacity limits in adults (Cowan, 2001;
C
owan et al., 2004), it does not constitute a full explanation of capacity increas es in immediate
memoryobservedinchildren(Gilchristetal.,2009),orage-relateddeclinesinimmediatememory
(Naveh-Benjamin et al., 2007; Gilchrist et al., 2008). It has been argued that capacity increases in
m
emory during child development were due to a growth in the number of items that can be held
independentlyofoneanother,nottoanincreaseinchunksize( Gilchristetal.,2009;Cowanetal.,

"Mathy et al. Span
Although chunking seems related to the deliberate
hierarchical reorganization of an input ( Ericsson et al., 1980;
Klahr et al., 1983; Servan-Schreiber and Anderson, 1990;
Perruchet and Vinter, 1998; Gobet et al., 2001; Rabinovich e t al.,
2014; Solway et al., 2014 ), another origin is a more perceptual
exploitation of statistical regularities in the environmen t
(Perruchet and Pacteau, 1990; Servan-Schreiber and Anderso n,
1990).Threetypesofregularitiescanbehighlighted.
Firstly, co-occurrences of events can be found in the input
stream. They can allow children to discover the words of a
language ( Saﬀran et al., 1996; Perruchet et al., 2014 ) without
relying on particular explicit strategies used for instance b y
adults becoming experts ( Chase and Simon, 1973a; Charness,
1979; Ericsson et al., 1980; Ericsson and Kintsch, 1995; Gob et
et al., 2001; Hu and Ericsson, 2012 ). Tracking the transitional
probabilitiesofaninputsuchas“bidakupadotigolabubidaku”f or
instance allows a child to incidentally segment the input str eam
into words. These newly formed words can be used to chunk
the previously encountered subsequences in a new input stream
presentingthesamestatisticalpatterns.
A second possibility for forming a chunk is to take proﬁt of a
unitization process that does not depend on the co-occurrence s
of subsequences, but which rather depends on the task at hand
(for instance, learning a particular sequence of motor actio ns
x−y−znomatteritsfrequency;see Perlmanetal.,2010;Minier
et al., 2015 ). In this case, the xyzchunk allows the participant to
speed up the motor actions, as when one retrieves the alphabet
(Klahretal.,1983 ).
A third way to form a chunk is to cluster together a set
of identical units of a sequence sometimes presented just onc e,
which has been referred to as a form of automatic or perceptual
chunking (clustering can be used for instance to train pigeon s
to learn lists more rapidly, Terrace, 1987 ; see also Gobet et al.,
2001).Someresearchsuggestthatinfantsareabletochunkobjec t
arrays when the objects are spatiotemporally grouped into two
setsoftwo( FeigensonandHalberda,2004 )andtoddlersareeven
abletoquicklyassignlabelstosuchnewlyformedchunks( Kibbe
and Feigenson, 2014 ). More diverse conditions were studied
byFeigenson and Halberda (2008) to show that perceptual,
conceptual, linguistic, or spatial cues are all suﬃciently eﬃ cient
to allow 14-month-old infants to store four-object arrays i n
memory. This literature suggests that an automatic process i s
available to children to recode information, which will serv e as
a working hypothesis in the present study to test if children
have a general ability to recode information to increase mem ory
eﬃciencyregardlessofage.Toextendthesepreviousstudies ,our
goal was also to examine how information in working memory
can be reorganized on the ﬂy using a recoding process that
can rely on external visual cues rather than internally store d
knowledge.
Becauseconceptualizationsofolderchildrenaremorerobus t,
we thought that reducing previously acquired knowledge woul d
be best for studying how limited-capacity memory can be
expanded by mentally organizing stimuli in working memory.
The present study therefore investigates how working memory
capacity is enhanced with the development of chunking abiliti es
using a novel approach based on an old game (SIMON/circleR).The original game consists of asking individuals to reproduc e a
sequence of colors that lights up by pressing four correspondi ng
colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue). The game starts with
lighting one color at random and progressively increases the
number of colors whenever the reproduction by the player is
correct.Gendle and Ransom (2006) reported a procedure for
measuring a working memory span using SIMON/circleR, and they
showedthattheprocedureisresistanttopracticeeﬀects.Previ ous
studies have shown that this setting has many advantages for
measuring the memory span of diﬀerent populations, including
those with speech or hearing pathologies ( Karpicke and Pisoni,
2004;GendleandRansom,2006 ).
In our version of SIMON/circleR, the chunks in the to-be-
remembered sequences were not generated by an artiﬁcial
grammar as in another study ( Karpicke and Pisoni, 2004 ).
Instead,weposedthatthechunkabilityofthesequencescould be
measuredbytheiralgorithmiccomplexity,anotionthatlink sthe
compressibility of a sequence to its simplicity. The algorith mic
complexity of a sequence is the length of the shortest algorith m
that is able to build the sequence ( Kolmogorov, 1965; Li and
Vitányi,1997 ).Incodingtheory,thegoalofanalgorithmusedfor
datacompressionistoattempttoﬁndanykindofregularityina n
input to encode, store and transmit information more eﬃcient ly
without any loss of data (i.e., the uncompressed data is ident ical
to the original data). From this perspective, a chunk can be see n
as a new representation obtained with an optimally compressed
code.Putsimply,asequencecanbecompressedwhenatleastone
chunkcanbeusedtorecodearegularsubsequenceintoasmall er
subsequence1.
When test circumstances allow a recoding process, the data
compression approach can prove successful to account for
how chunks can be formed rapidly without calling upon a
consolidationprocessinlong-termmemory. MathyandFeldman
(2012)have for instance shown that compressibility in to-be-
remembered sequences of digits was used by adult participants
for immediate serial report. Their model estimated that the
length of the compressed lists held in working memory was
approximately 3–4 chunks, which corresponds to the working
memorycapacitylimitsfoundbymanyotherinvestigatorsusin g
diverse protocols hindering a chunking process ( Cowan, 2001 ).
However, their estimation of the capacity limit was also in lin e
with theMiller’s (1956) 7±2 estimate because the 3–4 alleged
compressed subsequences corresponded to seven uncompressed
remembered items on average. Still, the more robust estimate
acrosstheirexperimentswasthenumberofcompressedlists(3 –
4), not the number of uncompressed items that instead varied
freely depending on the manipulated compressibility of the
sequences.

One basic idea is that a short algorithm such as “FOR
i=1:7, PRINT xxy” (or in somebody’s mind, a more
natural rule such as “7 ×xxy”) can account for the low
complexityof xxyxxyxxyxxyxxyxxyxxy .Incomparison,thestring
xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy might require a trivial algorithm such
as “PRINT xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy ” (i.e., the string itself, when
no regularity can be detected by the compression process). A
minimum description length approach (e.g., Rissanen, 1978;
Robinet et al., 2011 ) can be used to know whether the recoding
of the subsequence xxxinto a new symbol zcan allow a
greater compression of xyxxxyxxyxxxyxyyxxxxy . It could hardly
be the case for the present example because “ z=xxx, PRINT
xyzyxxyzyxyyzxy ” is globally not shorter than the original string
(since the rewriting process includes “ z=xxx”! But note
that better recoding is not excluded). Although such a recod ing
process is not excluded in humans, it is not practical to estima te
thecompressibilityofashortsequence.
One limitation of the minimum description length is that
it deeply relies on the arbitrary choice of a particular coding
language. A more neutral and objective approach particularly
suitable for the short sequences used in the present study (i. e.,
containing less than a dozen symbols) is to approximate the
algorithmic complexity by use of the coding theorem method
(Gauvrit et al., 2014, 2015; Dieguez et al., 2015 ). This method
is based on the fact that K(s)≈log2(m(s)), where K(s)
is the algorithmic complexity of the sequence s, andm(s) is
the probability that a randomly chosen deterministic algori thm
produces s. The method uses the fact that the compressibility
of a sequence is directly related to the probability that is
randomlygeneratedbyanunspeciﬁedmachine2.Unfortunately,
this approach involves that we cannot know what the optimal
compressedcodeisexactly.
To do so, we estimated the complexity of a set of random
sequences of four colors using the algorithmic complexity for
short strings (accs) R package ( Gauvrit et al., 2014 ), and we
split for each list length the simpler sequences from the more
complexsequencestoconstructthechunkablevs.non-chunka ble
experimental conditions. The non-chunkable sequences will
serve as a baseline for estimating participants’ storage capac ity
(forinstance,acapacitytoretainfouritemswouldbefoursl ots).
The chunkable sequences will serve for estimating participan ts’
storage capacity while chunking occurs (for instance, eight

whenitisrandomorshowsnoparticularregularityorstructure.Thus, algorithmic
complexity shall not be confused with other measures, such as Benne tt’s logical
depth, which is intended to capture structural complexity. For insta nce, the
decimals of πcan be produced by short algorithms such as the recursive
Leibniz formula, and thus have a low algorithmic complexity. Yet, the alg orithm
computing the πdecimals needs a long time to produce new decimals: so, the
series has a large Bennett’s logical depth. A direct comparison of algo rithmic

when controlling for the length of the string ( Soler-Toscano et al., 2013 ). (2)
Contrary to Bennett’s logical depth, algorithmic complexity is a direct measure of
how compressible a string is, and is therefore particularly relevant to our pre sent
study.(3)Unlike measures based on speciﬁc compression algorithms such as the
Lempel-Ziv method, algorithmic complexity makes no assumption about what
type of compression method is required, but nevertheless determines how much

memory capacity with age ( Pascual-Leone, 1970; Burtis, 1982;
Case et al., 1982 ). This is what we call the null scenario among
the following set of predictions. A second case was that if an
automatic chunking process is already available to infants a nd
toddlers ( Feigenson and Halberda, 2008 ) when a few redundant
information is prompted into the task, the span of children
across all ages for the chunkable sequences should increase in
an additive manner. For instance, if older children are able to
groupperceptuallytworegularitemsintoanewchunk,thesame
two items should be grouped by younger children, regardless o f
theirspan.Forinstance,fora blue−blue−red−greensequence,
the youngest children would automatically encode and corre ctly
recallblue−bluewith a span of one chunk (let’s hypothesize
a similar correct recall of blue−blueno matter its position
in the sequence). Older children would recall blue−blue−
redwith a span of two chunks, and the oldest would recall
the four items with a span of three chunks. Another example
is if the span increases from ﬁve to six in older children for
the non-chunkable and the chunkable sequences, respectivel y,
a group of younger children having a span of three for the
non-chunkable sequences should show the same increase of on e
item for the chunkable sequences, which would allow them to
reach a span of four on average. This prediction is based on the
possibilitythatcapturingaregularitydoesnotinvolveanys ortof

two automatically grouped items into a chunk would not reﬂect
an ability to reorganize information within each slot to mul tiply

A third case reﬂecting an absence of increase in chunking
would show a similar gain in information reorganization at
diﬀerent ages. For instance, if older children are able to
reorganize information to reach seven items for the chunkab le
sequencesinsteadofﬁveitemsforthenon-chunkablesequen ces,
they show a capacity to pack on average 7 /5=1.4 items per
chunk.Iftheyoungerchildrencanshowthesameabilitybase don
a smaller starting capacity of three items for the non-chunka ble
sequences, they should show a capacity of 3 ×1.4=4.2 items
for the chunkable sequences. This is a multiplicative scenari o
of capacity, but still this is an additive scenario on the log o f
capactity (i.e., because the multiplier eﬀect is constant, the lo g
of capacity shows an additive eﬀect). For instance, log2(4.2)−

log2(3)=0.49,aswellas log2(7)−log2(5)=0.49.Nointeraction
between age and the chunking factor should occur under this

Finally, if chunk size increases with age, the span for the
chunkable sequences should increase more than multiplicati vely
with the span. This prediction would involve that a true
reorganization process occurs within each of the available s lots

1. METHODS
Tostudyabilitiestoformchunksinimmediatememory,ourgo al
was to prompt a recoding process based on external cues rather
than one based on internal knowledge (to avoid contribution
from long-term memory). Children were administered a task
of immediate serial report inspired of the SIMON/circleR, a memory
game made of four colored buttons (red, green, yellow, blue)

repetitionscouldoccurtoinducearecodingprocessontheﬂy.
1.1. Participants
A total of 374 healthy children were split into ﬁve age groups:
6-year-olds ( M=6.1 years, SD=0.20,n=54), 7-year-olds
(M=7.0 years, SD=0.26,n=70), 8-year-olds ( M=8.0 years,
SD=0.28,n=94), 9-year-olds ( M=8.9 years, SD=0.29,
n=92), and 10-year-olds ( M=9.9 years, SD =0.27,n=64),
from several public schools of the same county (note that most
schools in France are public). Most children were from middle-
class families. All of the children participated voluntarily , and
their parents signed an informed consent form. None of these
participantswerecolorblind.
1.2. Design
The one to-be-remembered sequence consisted of a series of
colored squares presented serially at the speed of 1000 ms per
color (Figure1). Each sequence started with a ﬁxation cross
centered on the screen for 1000 ms. Following the sequence,
a recall screen displayed four colored buttons on which the
participants were invited to click to recall the whole sequenc e
in the correct order. Contrary to the original game, the task
was nonspatial: each color item was presented in the center of
the screen one after another. The main reason for running a
nonspatial version of the task was that our method was not
developed to measure the complexity of spatial patterns in 2D.
Instead, it was developed to measure the regularity of a (1D)
stringofsymbols.Spatialpatternssuchas“fourcolorsclock wise,”
FIGURE 1 | Illustrative example of a sequence of three colors fo r the

screen in which the four colors were randomly placed on each of t he
four locations at each trial. The 1000-ms timing was in reality split between
a 400-ms presentation of the color followed by an inter-stim ulus interval of 600
ms during which a blank gray screen was displayed.
“two diagonals,” “top row, bottom row” would also probably
haveinterferedwiththeregularityinthesequencesofcolo rsthat
our metric captures. To further discourage spatial encoding, we
randomly assigned the colors in the response screen to the fou r
possible quadrants for each new trial. The colors were therefo re

pads were brieﬂy lit up with lighter colors during 300 ms, as if a
bulb was rapidly turned on. Clicking on the colors was paced by
this lighting of the pad (the children could not click on the next
colorwhilethecurrentpadwaslit).
Feedback(“perfect”or“notexactly”)wasdisplayedaccording
to the accuracy of the response after the participant validated
the response using the press bar. Feedback was given to tell the
participantwhethertheresponsewascorrectornot.Thisinsur ed
forinstancethattheparticipantswouldrememberthattheywer e

The participants were given two complexity conditions
(counterbalanced between participants). The Simple condition
prompted a chunking process, while the Complex condition
solicited less chunking opportunities. The sequences in each
conditionweretakenfromarandomdistributionofthousands of
sequences for which we computed their algorithmic complexity .
The sequences were then ranked according to their complexity ,
with the 100th percentile corresponding to the most complex
sequences. The sequences in the Chunkable (i.e., simple) and
Non-chunkable (i.e., complex) conditions were chosen at the
25th and the 75th percentile to constitute the two experimental
conditions. Sequences around the lowest percentile would
correspond to repeated sequences of the same color (e.g., “blu e-
blue-blue ...”) and while 100th seemed a good choice to use the
mostcomplexsequences,wechosetorestrictallofthesequenc es
of length four and up to three colors only, which lowered thei r
complexity. Our goal was to best match the number of chosen

colors between the two conditions, and we thought that havin g
four colors in the chunkable condition would not allow enoug h
chunkingopportunitiestodetectchildren’sabilities.
The procedure matched a standard memory span task (e.g.,
the working memory subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Sca le
for Children/Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) in which t he
length of the to-be-remembered sequences progressively
increases, starting with length two. For each condition
(Chunkable and Non-chunkable), there were two diﬀerent
sequences per length but the task automatically stopped when
the participant was unable to correctly recall the two sequenc es
ofagivenlength.
Table1showsasampleofsequencesgiventoparticipants.The
two sequences of length two were identical in both condition s
(e.g.,blue−red, thengreen−yellow) in order to have the
participants use all of the colors at least once during the ﬁrst
two trials, as a warm-up. Noteworthy is that these four colors
are one-syllable words in French. Sequences of length three
only contained two diﬀerent colors in both conditions (e.g.,
green−yellow−yellowfor a chunkable simple sequence, and
blue−yellow−bluefor a less-chunkable complex sequence).
In both conditions, the sequences of length four and up never
contained more than three diﬀerent colors. One opposite pair
(simplevs.complex)wouldbe yellow−blue−yellow−blue−blue
vs.yellow−red−green−red−yellow. Theyellow−red−
green−red−yellowis one example of a complex sequence
that still contains a regularity since it is a palindrome. Howe ver,
recoding the sequence as a palindrome probably requires more
computation than simply grouping the contiguous identical
colorsinyellow−blue−yellow−blue−blue(nottomentionthat
the palindrome is less noticeable when presented sequentiall y
thanwhenﬂattenedoutin Table1).Notethatwedidnotseekto
avoid completely a recoding process of the complex sequences,
since it was inevitable in some way for most sequences. Our
compressibility metric only insured that the Simple conditio n

1.3. Data Scoring and Data Analysis
The span was calculated using the all-or-nothing method
(Conway et al., 2005 ), in which credit was given to completely

2. RESULTS
First, we split the results according to task order (i.e., whe ther
the task was the ﬁrst one or the second one, regardless of the
manipulatedchunkingfactor).Therespectivespansfortheent ire
sample of participants were respectively 3.8 ( sd=1.1) for the
ﬁrst task and 3.9 ( sd=1.2) for the second task. The respective
spans using the highest span method were respectively 4.4 ( sd
=1.2) for the ﬁrst task and 4.4 ( sd=1.3) for the second task.
We observed no diﬀerence between the ﬁrst task and the second
task, for either of the span measures [ ts(373)<1.5,p>0.14].
Measures of the span using the all-or-nothing method or the
highest span method showed a high correlation ( r=0.93,
p<0.001,N=374; including when partialling out Age, r=
0.92,p<0.001,df=371), and regardless of task order (the
preceding statistics are given for the ﬁrst task, but the stat istical
resultswerestrictlyidenticalforthesecondtask).Given thehigh
correlation between our two span measures, we chose to rely
solely on the second measure (hereafter: Span) to conduct the
followinganalyses.

Although the gain in the chunkable condition in Figure2 is

the 6-year-olds in the non-chunkable condition (3.1), 4.3 i n the
chunkable condition still represented a large increase of 39 %
(whichwassigniﬁcant,aswellasallotherincreasesobserv edat7,

Another way to approach the idea that chunk size did not
increase with age was to divide for each subject their respect ive

3. DISCUSSION
Although the maximum span length achieved at the electronic
game SIMON/circleRrevolves around seven in adults ( Gendle and
Ransom, 2006 ), which recalls Miller’s (1956) magical number,
these seven items or so that adults can recall probably do not
reﬂect seven separate chunks (see Cowan, 2005 , chapter 3).
Playing with the SIMON/circleRlooks like an ability to adapt to new
situationsinwhichonedoesnothavemuchexpertise,excepttha t

place exactly in such a game remains diﬃcult to approach, the
primary goal of the current study was to observe age diﬀerences

3.1. Immediate Memory Capacity
Development
If one wants to comprehend the growth of immediate memory
capacities across development, it is important to know exactly
what one is measuring through immediate memory tasks. As
emphasized by Cowan et al. (2015) , it is well-known that when
one tries to measure immediate memory capacities, various
factors can impact performance. Hence, a great deal of researc h
these last 40 years has been to identify the key factors that
determine immediate memory capacity. An important eﬀort
has been put into controlling some of these factors to verify
whether immediate memory capacity still grows with age
when these factors are neutralized, in particular the knowle dge
factor. Eﬀectively, chunking in general refers to the amount
of information that can be stored by meaningfully grouping
information. Case et al. (1982) famously showed that if one
controls the familiarity of the items (which operationalize s
knowledge),nodevelopmentaldiﬀerencesinimmediatememory
appearinawordspanwhencomparingadultstochildren(here6
year-olds). However, since then, results have more often sho wn
that immediate memory development is not entirely due to
knowledge, and Case himself proposed another interpretation
of his own results (for this rebuttal see Case, 1995 ). The same
year,Burtis (1982) observed that when chunking strategies were
controlled using matrices of letters, there was still a growt h of
immediate memory capacity with age. Cowan and colleagues
in several other studies ( Cowan et al., 2010b, 2011, 2015 ) have
systematicallycontrolledvariouselementsthatcouldexpla inthe
growth of immediate memory capacities. Cowan et al. (2010b)
showed that even when one controls the ability to exclude less -
relevant items, age diﬀerences in terms of immediate memory
remain. Similarly when encoding diﬀerences are neutralized ,
immediate memory diﬀerences still exist between age groups
(Cowan et al., 2011 ). More recently, Cowan et al. (2015)
controlled familiarity, which enabled to manipulate the size of
chunks through the use of knowledge. They used visual arrays

"Mathy et al. Span
of English letters vs. unfamiliar characters with a probe ite m
recognition paradigm. Even with unfamiliar characters, tha t is,
when the contribution of knowledge was minimal and therefor e
when chunking was minimal, there still was an increase of
immediate memory capacities from ﬁrst grade (7 years-old) to
seventhgrade(12years-old).Thisincreasewascomparablet othe
oneobservedwithEnglishletters.Asresumptivelyputby Cowan
et al. (2015) , whatever type of control is adopted, immediate
memoryseemstoalwaysincreasewithage.
Our study controlled the strategic factor by reducing
the possibility to form chunks (in the condition for which
compressibility was minimal). In contrast to previous studie s,
we believe that our task better reduces the role of acquired
knowledge. Our results are identical to those of Cowan and
colleagues: when we reduced potential chunking strategies,
we still observe an increase in span with age. However, it
must be noted that our manipulation draws on a diﬀerent
kind of chunking. According to Gobet et al. (2001) , chunking
can be dichotomized into two categories depending on when
chunking occurs. The ﬁrst category assumes a goal-oriented
chunking (e.g., Miller, 1956 ), thought to be deliberate, where
conscious strategies can play an important role. The second
is perceptual chunking (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973a ), which
is putatively more automatic and implicit, and which can be
primitive ( Feigenson and Halberda, 2008 ). As presented in the
introduction, we believe that the repetition of colors enabl es
the participants to heavily rely on such perceptual chunking by
exploiting the statistical regularities of the repeated colo rs, but
strategic factors can also be developed consciously. In the ca se
of letters, the recoding possibilities seem more goal-orien ted.
Even if neither of the two types of chunking –in our works
or inCowan et al.’s (2015) – are entirely perceptual or goal-
oriented, we believe that our task draws more on perceptual
chunking than Cowan et al.’s (2015) . Hence for the ﬁrst time,
our results show that even when one controls for perceptual
chunking (which is reduced in our complex condition, thus
allowing minimal rapid re-encoding of information on the ﬂy) ,
there still is an increase of immediate memory capacity with
age. Our ﬁndings adds one more controlled factor to account
for the growth of immediate memory capacity, after knowledge
diﬀerences, encoding diﬀerences, and resistance to interfer ence
diﬀerences. One conclusion is that our observation that ther e is
aprogressiveincreaseofcapacitywithageinournon-chunkab le
condition makes clear that the capacity to rapidly form chunks
on-line does not solely account for the growth of immediate
memory capacity. Something else is at stake to support the
growth of the memory span. Conversely, our observation that
there is not a greater progressive increase of capacity with ag e
in the chunkable condition –than in the chunkable condition –
means that chunk size cannot easily be increased by direct
manipulation of information in immediate memory by children
less than 10 years old. Chunks formed in long-term memory are
probably a unique result of a consolidation process and childr en
are probably better oﬀ using knowledge (i.e., chunks previous ly
formed) to increase capacity than trying to re-organize the n ew
incominginformationontheﬂy.3.2. Number of Chunks Increases with
Development but not Size
Our originality was also to use a similar material (i.e., simpl e
sequences of colors) for the chunkable vs non-chunkable
conditions (whereas Cowan et al., 2015 , for instance compared
the span for chunkable letters against non-chunkable unfami liar
characters).Themainresultofthecurrentstudyisthatwef ound

and expertise (e.g., Chase and Simon, 1973b; Gobet and Simon,
1996a,b;Guidaetal.,2012 ).Forchildren,thestoryisdiﬀerentand
more complicated. Some studies, like ours, shows that with age ,
thenumberofchunksincreaseswhiletheirsizeremainstable .For
example, Gilchrist et al. (2009) investigated the development of
working memory and chunks by manipulating the number, the
size and the meaning of sentences. The size of the chunks was
operationalized by the proportion of each sentence recalled, a nd
thenumberofsentencesrecalled,enablingtheauthorstota pthe
numberofadoptedchunks.Theauthorsobservedthatthechunk
size was stable from the ﬁrst group (7-years-olds) to the las t one
(youngadults),whilethenumberofchunksorslotsinimmedi ate
memory increased. Interestingly, even if our operationaliz ation
ofthesizeandnumberofchunksisatoddswiththatof Gilchrist
et al. (2009) , we found exactly the same results. The average
ratio we calculated showed that the number of items that could
be packed in the chunkable condition in comparison to the
non-chunkable condition was stable across the diﬀerent grou ps.
The knowledge that children obviously accumulate in long-t erm
memory does not seem to transfer to re-encoding information
on the ﬂy to form new associations, which stays stable in our
study, and might be primitive. Using the repeated colors, chun k
size could not depend on the participant’s knowledge much.
Instead, we show that encoding regular sequences is a primiti ve
process in children (see for instance our analysis on how the
pairs of colors were encoded equally well when the items were
repeated, regardless of age), and we believe this process can pla y
animportantroleintheformationofchunksinthelong-term.

"Mathy et al. Span
Even if our results conceptually replicate those of Gilchrist
et al. (2009) , opposite results do exist. Ottem et al. (2007)
for example found that immediate memory span development
reﬂects an increase in the size of each chunk rather than an
increase of the number of chunks. This conclusion was drawn
from three studies with participants’ age ranging from 3 to 16
years-old. When the correlation between immediate memory
span and language abilities was taken into consideration, no
evidence of a relation between immediate memory span and age
wasobserved.Interestingly,thisisalsowhatJonesandcoll eagues
(Jones et al., 2008, 2014 ) found using CLASSIC and EPAM-
VOC.Thesetwocomputationalmodelsbasedonchunkingwere

repetitionwasindependentofworkingmemorysize.Thecrucia l
factortoaccountforthedatawaslong-termmemoryknowledg e,
and this showed that the size of working memory increases
thankstotheincreaseofchunkssize,notthenumberofchunk s.
Also relating to language abilities, Hulme et al. (1984) showed
a linear relationship between speech rate and memory span in
both children and adults, supporting the idea that increase of
speech rate with age could account solely for the development
of the memory span (i.e., a greater number of sounds can be
contained in a two second period with faster articulation). T his
account is not incompatible with a growth of memory capacity.
This results could eﬀectively be reinterpreted as the idea tha t
greater speech rate can increase what can be encoded within
chunks. Regarding our study, if so, a greater speech ability wi th
age should have facilitated the articulation of several repe ated
colors instead of switching colors. Such a process would have
favored the chunkable sequences, but such an eﬀect was not
observed.
3.3. Limitation and the Way Forward
One limitation of the present study is that the modeling of
compressibility is unable so far to determine the exact numbe rofadoptedchunkswithage.Althoughthecompressibilitymetr ic
is useful to apprehend the compressibility of a whole sequence,
it does not compute the number of actual chunks within a
sequence. Computing the exact number of separate chunks that
allowanoptimalrecodingofashortsequenceisalineofresea rch
for the future. In the present study, analysis of the response
times (to detect chunk boundaries) would be untestable since
the repetition of colors necessarily involved quicker clicks of the
mouse. One further line of experiments would be for instance
to systematically vary the location of the colored pads after each
click, to better understand the actual internal processes in volved
informingchunks(see Gilchrist,2015 ,forothermethodssuchas
addingneurophysiologicalmeasurestochunkingresearch,w hich
could be combined with models of compressibility to determin e
better the processes involved in the formation of chunks). Su ch
experiments would be a more sophisticated way to predict how
manyitemscanbecombinedtoformnewchunkson-line.

"REVIEW
Systematic Review: Educational Accommodations for
Children and Adolescents With Attention-De ﬁcit/
Hyperactivity Disorder
Benjamin J. Lovett, PhD, and Jason M. Nelson, PhD
Objective: Children and adolescents with attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often receive instruction and take tests using educational
accommodations. This review aims to summarize and integrate the research literature on accommodations for this speci ﬁc population.
Method: Electronic databases in medicine (MEDLINE), psychology (PsycINFO), and education (ERIC) were systematically searched (last update
January 13, 2020), with inclusion criteria selecting any document with a focus on accommodations in educational settings or on academic tasks forchildren or adolescents with ADHD. The search yielded 497 unique documents. Additional searches yielded 13 more documents. Of the 510 total
potentially useful documents, 68 met criteria for topical relevance and age range, to be discussed in the narrative review. The wide range of document
types led to a qualitative synthesis.
Results: Accommodations are by far the most common response to ADHD in educational settings, with testing accommodations such as extended
time being particularly prevalent. However, most accommodations fail to show evidence of bene ﬁts that are speci ﬁc to students with ADHD, and many
of the more common accommodations have few or no experimental studies supporting them. An exception is read-aloud accommodations, which have
two randomized experiments ﬁnding speci ﬁc bene ﬁts for younger students with ADHD. Students and those who work with them often express
ambivalence and dissatisfaction over the accommodations process.
Conclusion: More empirical research is needed to examine the effects of these extremely common supports. In the absence of supportive evidence,
health professionals should be hesitant to recommend accommodations immediately after a diagnosis. Even when such evidence exists, educational
accommodations should only be provided along with evidence-based interventions, or after interventions have failed, as suggested by the “life course ”
model of managing ADHD.
Key words: ADHD, educational accommodations, school services

ttention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is a common childhood-onset psychiatric disor-
der that causes substantial impairment in real-
world functioning.1Because educational settings require
sustained attentional focus and self-control, ADHD is
particularly likely to affect academic performance and
school behavior more generally. On average, students with
ADHD obtain lower class marks, learn less in school, and
are more likely to repeat a grade or fail to complete high
school.2-5However, several school-based interventions have
shown effectiveness for this population. Meta-analyses have
supported the use of organizational skills training (showing
large effects on those skills but also small-to-medium effects
on inattention symptoms and academic performance6)a s
well as instructional interventions such as use of ﬂash cards
and writing strategy training (showing medium to largeeffects on both behavioral and academic outcomes7). Even
medication interventions appear to have effects —albeit
small ones —on academic skills, and particularly on speed
and productivity of academic responses.8Unfortunately,
intervention implementation is often challenging and un-
even in practice, and even research-based interventions are
unlikely to completely eliminate the gap in achievement
between students with and without ADHD.
In addition to interventions, or in lieu of them, many
students with ADHD receive educational accommodations.
The most well-known accommodations are in the context
of testing and assessment; a student with ADHD may be
permitted to take tests with a longer time limit, or in a
separate room, or having the items read aloud by a teacher.9
However, instructional accommodations are also available;
these may involve providing personal reminders aboutA

"assignment due dates to a student with ADHD, or allowing
a student to answer only the even-numbered homeworkproblems.
10In either case, the essential content of the ac-
ademic program (instruction or testing) is retained, but the
mode of administering an aspect of the program (the
timing, scheduling, setting, presentation style, or response
format) is altered. Unlike interventions, which aim to
change the student ’s levels of skills or other traits, accom-
modations adjust the delivery of the academic program to
the student ’s current state, changing the expectations for the
student.
This article systematically reviews the research literature
on educational accommodations for children and adoles-cents with ADHD. The goal is to integrate this information
to learn when and how accommodations are being provided
to this population, as well as how useful and appropriate
such accommodations are, and how they are perceived by
stakeholders in the accommodations process. In addition to
identifying the most effective practices and programs, gaps
in current knowledge and implications for future research
will be discussed.
METHOD
We followed PRISMA guidelines for our review. Our
PRISMA checklist is provided as Figure S1, available online.
Search Strategy
We used the EBSCO library to simultaneously search
electronic databases in medicine (MEDLINE), psychology
(PsycINFO), and education (ERIC). We searched the full
text of database records for the combination of “attention
deﬁcit”and“accomm* ”. The ﬁnal update to the EBSCO
search occurred on January 13, 2020, and several additional
documents were identi ﬁed later, as part of the review
process.
Study Selection
We cast a wide net, both topically and methodologically,
with regard to which documents were included. Topically,
the principal inclusion criteria were that a document was
required (a) to have a signi ﬁcant focus on the topic of
ADHD, (b) to speci ﬁcally concern children or adolescents,
and (c) to concern accommodations (or have clear, explicit
implications for accommodations) in school settings or on
academic tasks (including testing). Methodologically, we
considered large-scale experimental and nonexperimentalstudies, case studies, legal analyses, and conceptual papers,
among other documents, and we included dissertations and
reports from government bodies and advocacy groups as
well as peer-reviewed journal articles. This exploratoryapproach led us to develop categories of documents as we
reviewed the literature, rather than starting from a prioricategories. Given this breadth of literature, we were careful
to identify what evidence on which each document based its
claims. To reduce risk of bias during evidence synthesis, we
included unpublished as well as published work (to address
possible publication bias), and we examined results our-
selves (and in some cases performed independent calcula-
tions) rather than relying solely on researchers ’own
conclusions (to address possible interpretive biases).
The primary reason that documents were excluded at
the abstract review stage was an insuf ﬁcient focus on ac-
commodations (eg, a brief mention of accommodations in amore general paper on management of ADHD). Other
common reasons for exclusion were a focus on older pop-
ulations (particularly college students, who ﬁt better in the
adult ADHD literature) and a different meaning of the term
“accommodation ”(eg, articles on the ocular accommoda-
tion re ﬂex in students with ADHD). Both authors reviewed
all abstracts and discussed any cases in which there was
disagreement as to whether to obtain the document ’s full
text. The authors then reviewed full-text documents todetermine whether each document was relevant, and if so,
to extract ﬁndings of interest. Given the wide range of types
of documents, qualitative synthesis was used to integrate
results across documents.
RESULTS
A total of 68 documents met full inclusion criteria (see
Figure 1 for the PRISMA ﬂow chart and Tables S1 and S2,
available online, for summaries and classi ﬁcations of all
documents). Consistent with our broad search, we found
documents providing relevant information about the
following topics: the current legal framework supporting
students ’rights to educational accommodations; the prev-
alence of accommodations; the effectiveness of various ac-
commodations; perceptions of the accommodations process;
and proposals for improving current practices. Of the 68
documents, more contained original empirical data (31
empirical articles in peer-reviewed journals, 9 dissertation
studies, and 3 reports covering empirical studies by research
institutes) than did not (12 conceptual/review articles in
peer reviewed journals, 9 reports from government entities
or foundations, 3 chapters in edited books, and 1 auth-
ored book).
The typical levels of evidence used in medical reviews
could not be easily applied to many of the documents; a
legal analysis might have strong evidence through its cita-
tion of authoritative sources, and the strength of the logic of
its argument would not rely on the features of high-quality

Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021EDUCATIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ADHD",paper28.pdf,2
"empirical studies. Even for the empirical studies, markers of
the quality of research were highly dependent on the study
type, and so we provide general characterization of quality
markers below, and more details in Table S2, available
online.
Legal Framework for Accommodations
We found 9 documents with relevant information con-cerning the legal framework for accommodations for stu-dents with ADHD. Three federal laws provide for possible
educational accommodations for these students, and
different laws are relevant depending on which sort of
school a student attends. First, public schools must enforce
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
which covers any student who meets criteria for any of 13
categories of disability and requires special education or
related services to achieve an appropriate education. These
covered students receive an Individualized Education Pro-
gram (IEP), which often lists accommodations, particularly
for state examinations. Although ADHD is not one of the13 of ﬁcial categories, many students with ADHD are served
under IDEA,
11speciﬁcally under its categories of Other
Health Impairment (OHI), Emotional Disturbance (ED),
and Speci ﬁc Learning Disability (SLD).12,13IEPs contain
not only accommodations, but individualized educational
goals and objectives for the student, which must be moni-
tored continuously by school staff. Importantly, the deci-
sion to classify a student under IDEA and the content of an
IEP are at the school district ’s discretion, albeit with
parental input; neither a diagnosis of ADHD, nor a phy-
sician ’s recommendation for an IEP, requires the school to
create one.14Moreover, many students with valid ADHD
diagnoses will not require an IEP and should have standard
curriculum goals.15
Students who are in schools receiving any federal
funding are protected by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against in-
dividuals with disabilities. All public K-12 schools fall under
this law, and so do a small number of specialized private
schools that are for students with special needs. ManyFIGURE 1 PRISMA Flow Chart
450 www.jaacap.org Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021LOVETT AND NELSON",paper28.pdf,3
"students in covered schools receive “504 Accommodation
Plans ”that mention an ADHD diagnosis. All schools
(whether public or private) as well as independent testing
agencies (such as the ACT, a test used for US college
admission) fall under a similar law, the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA).16Both Section 504 and ADA
generally de ﬁne a disability as a condition (such as ADHD)
that substantially limits a major life activity, and “concen-
trating ”is explicitly mentioned as an example of such an
activity, as are other activities in which some students with
ADHD are limited (eg, reading). However, although many
students with ADHD are disabled under the 504/ADA
deﬁnition,17,18the determination of disability is distinct
from a diagnosis, and not all students with ADHD di-
agnoses will need accommodations under Section 504.
Students who only receive 504/ADA services generally do
not have individualized educational goals, just accommo-
dations, and the number of students who only have 504
plans have grown substantially in recent years.19
Prevalence of Educational Accommodations
Our search retrieved 32 documents relevant to the preva-
lence of accommodations. Many studies have found that
accommodations are the most common management
strategy for ADHD in educational settings. Their frequency
is high, both relative to other strategies and in an absolute
sense; studies generally ﬁnd that the most common ac-
commodation —namely, extended time on tests —is pro-
vided to over 80% of students with school-recognized
ADHD.12,20-23Other very common accommodations are
alterations to assignments (eg, extended time or shorter
assignments), access to a calculator for mathematics, a
separate setting in which to take tests, and preferentialseating (eg, near the teacher). It is typical to receive multiple
testing accommodations; for instance, one study of 88 IEPs
found an average of 2.62 testing accommodations per stu-
dent with ADHD.
22However, interestingly, the number of
accommodations that a student receives does not appear to
relate to the severity of that individual ’s ADHD.20
Accommodations are popular regardless of whether
students with ADHD are receiving services in a general
education classroom or in a self-contained special educationsetting,
24,25and some research has explored the creative
accommodations that are provided in classes such as mu-
sic26,27and foreign language.28Instructional accommoda-
tions in particular, while associated with ADHD, are given
by some teachers to students both with and without the
disorder, according to teacher surveys as well as review of
ofﬁcial school records.29,30In 3 studies, researchers have
observed that evidence-based interventions such as behavior
management plans are actually less common thanaccommodations.23,31,32For instance, in one study of a
representative sample of 107 high school students withADHD who had special education or accommodation
plans, 87.9% received extended testing time accommoda-
tions, but only 24.1% had a behavior management program
and only 37.1% received learning strategies or study skills
assistance.
21Finally, students with ADHD are a group well
represented in research on testing accommodations, second
only to students with learning disabilities.33
Part of the high popularity of accommodations for
ADHD may stem from government guidance documents
(eg, from state departments of education), position papers
from advocacy groups, and educational resource manuals,all of which tend to provide lengthy lists of accommodations
for students with ADHD, without mentioning evidence
that the accommodations are effective or appropriate.
34–41
Similarly, articles and books in the professional literature
for teachers often provide such lists.42–46One group of
researchers even developed a worksheet for school staff to
rate their frequency of using various accommodations, while
also identifying barriers to use (that can presumably be
addressed, to increase the number of accommodations thatstudents with ADHD receive).
47A related feature that may
increase popularity is that many accommodations are far less
expensive and intensive to provide, compared to in-
terventions, which can be costly.48Finally, diagnosticians
have acknowledged that students experiencing pressure for
high performance may seek ADHD accommodations to
have a boost in performance, whether or not they are truly
disabled.49This has led scholars to suggest that diagnostic
assessments should include specialized measures to detect
adolescents who may be exaggerating impairment by over-
reporting symptoms or deliberately performing poorly oncognitive tasks.
50
Effectiveness of Accommodations
We found 22 documents that included information aboutthe effectiveness of accommodations. There is no single,
agreed-upon metric for determining the effectiveness of an
accommodation; the simplest one —a positive effect on
grades or test scores —would arguably not be meaningful if it
were only due to lowered standards. A commonly mentionedstandard for effectiveness is therefore whether the accom-
modation only has positive effects —or has greater positive
effects —on students with ADHD than on their nondisabled
peers.
48,51,52The standard is based on accommodations for
sensory or physical disabilities; a test form in Braille or a
ramp into a building is primarily of bene ﬁt to individuals
with disabilities. However, below we consider effectiveness
more broadly, reporting whatever effects of accommodations
have been found in empirical research.
Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry www.jaacap.org 451
Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021EDUCATIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ADHD",paper28.pdf,4
"Nine studies have examined the effects of extended
testing time. On time-pressured tests, this accommodationdoes lead to higher test scores for students with ADHD, but
it also has this effect for nondisabled students, according to
studies of middle school students (N ¼54) and high school
students (N ¼1,929).
51,53These results converge with
those from a large-scale study of high school students with
and without ADHD diagnoses (N ¼784), which found
few differences in performance on a battery of timed reading
measures, and instead found more evidence of making
careless mistakes by students with ADHD, which would
support prompts to check for mistakes rather than a simple
provision of additional time.54Moreover, many teacher-
made classroom examinations are not heavily time pres-
sured, which may explain the lack of an association between
receiving services such as extended time and grade point
average (GPA) in students with ADHD (N ¼333).21
Finally, an interesting study calculated the rate of correct
worksheet completion among middle school students with
ADHD (N ¼33) under shorter and longer time limits,
ﬁnding that students ’work rate declined with extended
time55; this suggests that students with ADHD are likely to
use at least some of their extended time when it is provided,
whether or not the extended time is actually needed (see also
studies with similar ﬁndings for high school students taking
SAT/C0style tests56,57).
Although the evidence for extended time ’s appropri-
ateness appears to be generally weak, other research has at
least defended it against two criticisms. First, the concern
that it induces fatigue through lengthier test sessions does
not appear to be true, according to a study examining fa-
tigue in high school students with ADHD taking extended
time (versus standard time) versions of the SAT (which isalready much longer than typical classroom tests).
58Second,
according to another study using the SAT, extended time
does not signi ﬁcantly alter the factor structure of tests (ie,
the relationships between items) for students with ADHD
and/or learning disabilities (N ¼4,952), which is a key
psychometric property relating to tests ’validity.59
Read-aloud accommodations, in which items from a
paper test are presented orally to students with ADHD,
have also received empirical attention. Two randomizedexperiments (N ¼45 and N ¼36) have found that at least
for younger children with ADHD (aged /C2014 years), read-
aloud accommodations improve performance beyond any
beneﬁt seen in nondisabled peers.
52,60It may be that the
presence of a 1:1 adult proctor reading test items helps to
focus the student ’s attention; whether the bene ﬁts have to
do with reading de ﬁcits or redirection is unclear, although
many students with ADHD also have academic skill de ﬁ-
cits. The redirection explanation was endorsed by anotherstudy that sought to determine whether middle-school
students with ADHD (N ¼19) were getting test items
wrong “for the right reasons ”(ie, lacking skills that the items
are designed to measure) or due to a lack of access, and
which determined that some students with ADHD would
beneﬁt from read-aloud accommodations to improve test
engagement.61
Some accommodations that have a conceptual rela-
tionship to ADHD symptoms have nonetheless failed to
show signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts. For instance, students with
ADHD are often permitted to complete tests in a smaller
group on the theory that this would reduce distractions;
however, in one study, researchers found that children withADHD (N ¼33) actually completed a greater proportion
of test-like worksheets when in a larger group as opposed to
a smaller one.
62Another frequently recommended accom-
modation involves breaking assignments into smaller units,
on the logic that students with ADHD lack patience and
would bene ﬁt from more frequent reinforcement (from task
completion).27However, the only study that we located
examining this accommodation failed to ﬁnd any bene ﬁt for
elementary and middle school students with ADHD (N ¼
34), in terms of productivity or on-task behavior.63
Calculator accommodations are another common supportfor students with ADHD, but the only experimental study
on this point (a small-scale study that included 15 subjects
with ADHD) failed to ﬁnd any effects on performance on a
conceptual/application mathematics task (one not designed
to measure calculation skills).
64This is disappointing, given
the noted mathematics de ﬁcits seen in ADHD that have
prompted some scholars to advocate for accommodations.65
One intriguing study found mixed effects of an unusual
theory-based accommodation: the addition of “non-
informational color ”to text during reading tasks. The idea
here was that students with ADHD require additional
stimulation to maintain attention, and so making reading
text colored (despite the color not being relevant, as it
would be if it were highlighting key points in a text) was
expected to improve performance. The accommodation
signiﬁcantly increased the oral reading accuracy —but not
rate or comprehension —of a small group of third through
ﬁfth graders with ADHD (N ¼16).66
Finally, some studies have been suggestive without us-
ing research designs that permit con ﬁdent causal conclu-
sions about the effects of individual accommodations. For
instance, a nonexperimental study found that among
elementary and middle school students with ADHD (N ¼
96), the presence of various accommodations (extended
time, breaks, reduced-distraction location, calculator access,
and read-aloud) was not associated with scores on state
reading achievement tests; however, this may be due to a
452 www.jaacap.org Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021LOVETT AND NELSON",paper28.pdf,5
"selection bias, where students without such accommoda-
tions did not need them. Such an explanation is consistentwith the ﬁnding that calculator accommodations were
associated with lower state mathematics test scores in
elementary school students with ADHD.
20In other studies,
many management techniques have been implemented at
the same time (ie, accommodations as well as interventions),
and so any improvements in performance and behavior
cannot be attributed to accommodations per se.67,68
Perceptions of the Accommodations Process
There were 6 documents that contained information fromstudies examining what various stakeholders in the accom-modations process think about current practices. In a large-
scale mixed-methods study of adolescents, parents, teachers,
health care professionals, and school professionals (total
N¼569), adolescents were signi ﬁcantly less positive to-
ward testing accommodations, compared to other re-
spondents.
69However, respondents from other groups also
expressed concerns over how testing accommodations, by
physically segregating students, could lower self-esteem.
In another study, a group of 18 teachers, and a separate
group of 15 mother/student dyads, were interviewed about
the extended time accommodation for ADHD (of which all
students had diagnoses).70Approximately half of teachers
and parents had wholly positive views toward the accom-
modation, but many of each group were ambivalent, and
some teachers were actively opposed. Perhaps surprisingly,
students were the least positive group, with two-thirds
expressing ambivalence. The ambivalent students
expressed concerns related to fairness (sincerely questioning
the fairness of the accommodation but also noting worries
that classmates may ﬁnd it unfair); some teachers worried
that extended time unrealistically raises expectations for
student performance; and mothers questioned the bene ﬁts
of such an accommodation for students who are not slow
workers.
Ten mothers of students with ADHD were the focus of
a small-scale qualitative study about perceptions of the
ADHD management process more generally.71Of all the
aspects of that process, mothers found obtaining school
services to be most dif ﬁcult, expressing particular frustration
with obtaining Section 504 accommodations (all but 1
participant noted this). More generally, mothers perceived
school staff as lacking training and understanding about
ADHD. Parental concerns over 504 accommodations seem
to be validated by a study that interviewed parents, teachers,
and school 504 coordinators (total N ¼10) regarding
ADHD programming in the middle-school setting; the
interviews consistently elicited themes of a lack of training
in 504 issues for teachers, confusion over the role of 504coordinators, and inconsistency in implementing 504
plans.72Relatedly, in the only study to focus entirely on
school psychologists ’perceptions, fewer than one-third of
these professionals (of a total of 161 participants) believed
that accommodations of health-related conditions (mainly
ADHD) were handled well by teachers, and most re-
spondents felt that two speci ﬁc problems (namely, teachers ’
insufﬁcient understanding of the classroom implications of
disorders, and weak application of the understanding that
teachers do have) were at least “moderate ”barriers to
appropriate practice.13Therefore, even if teachers know of
many of the common accommodations given to students
with ADHD,73many stakeholders still see room for a great
deal of improvement in the accommodations process.
Improving Current Practices
Finally, we found 6 documents with a signi ﬁcant focus on
how to improve current practices. One was a study exam-
ining the effects of professional development programming
on teachers ’attitudes and behavior with regard to teaching
students with ADHD, including the provision of accom-
modations.74The investigators concluded that in-service
training (which included a presentation on accommoda-
tions as well as a sample accommodations plan) was effective
at increasing teachers ’stated willingness to provide accom-
modations, as well as their reported actual use of accom-
modations. Of course, such outcomes should be viewed as
positive only if the accommodations are effective and
appropriate, issues not discussed by the investigators.
Because ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, students
who have it will vary in terms of which accommodations are
most effective. One conceptual article proposed the use of
functional assessment for improving the process of deter-mining which accommodations to provide a student with
ADHD.
75Functional assessment is often used to understand
why misbehavior is occurring, by discovering relationships
between environmental events that set off or reinforce
misbehavior, and ample research supports this practice. The
extension of functional assessment to develop accommoda-
tion plans (along with interventions) is intriguing, and the
authors of the article give many helpful examples.
As students with ADHD become older, and speci ﬁcally
as they move through high school, they are expected to be
increasingly involved in developing their own IEPs or ac-
commodation plans. One intensive small-scale study
examined a training program to teach high school students
with ADHD (N ¼4) to self-advocate for needed accom-
modations (through practice in steps such as reporting past
accommodations and their perceived ef ﬁcacy), and this
program was found to be effective at making the students
better self-advocates.76

Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021EDUCATIONAL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR ADHD",paper28.pdf,6
"Finally, we found 3 conceptual/review articles that
presented formal models of services for managing ADHDthat included accommodations,
31,77,78as part of argu-
ments for improving the way in which services are pro-
vided. All 3 articles endorsed essentially the same
approach, reserving accommodations as either (1) a
temporary measure to use while trying out interventions,
or (2) a ﬁnal measure to use when interventions have
failed. One article presented a comprehensive “life course
model ”of services,78which attempts to use 4 strategies to
increase long-term independence. The model starts with
“foundational strategies ”(ensuring that the child ’s envi-
ronment is appropriate with regard to behavior manage-ment, and promoting positive relationships and
communication among the child, parents, and school
ofﬁcials); then adds behavioral and cognitive /C0behavioral
interventions to increase academic skills and to further
address behavior problems; then turns to medication if
psychosocial interventions are insuf ﬁcient; and then
ﬁnally provides accommodations if a student ’s skills/
behavior are still not adequate to meet task demands.
DISCUSSION
Child and adolescent psychiatrists and related health care
professionals, while not based in school settings, often
provide diagnostic documentation and management rec-
ommendations for students with ADHD that are presented
to school staff as authoritative, and so it is critical for such
professionals to understand educational accommodations
well. It is dif ﬁcult to summarize such a broad and diverse
body of documents on the topic, but 4 key conclusions were
evident. First, educational accommodations are extremely
common, the primary response to ADHD in schools.Supported by 3 separate laws at the federal level alone, they
are provided to the vast majority of students with ADHD
when schools recognize the condition. Second, experimental
studies of accommodations often fail to ﬁnd any ef ﬁcacy in
the sense of improving students ’performance, and it is even
rarer that they are found to have bene ﬁts that are speci ﬁct o
students with ADHD (as opposed to raising all students ’
performance, potentially lowering standards). Read-aloud
accommodations for younger students with ADHDemerged as the exception here, with multiple experiments
suggesting that the accommodation meets the stringent
standard of having bene ﬁts speci ﬁc to students with a
disability. Certainly, given the high prevalence of accom-
modations, and the lengthy lists of accommodations rec-
ommended in guidance documents and articles for teachers,
it is surprising how the evidence base for accommodations ’
efﬁcacy is comparatively thin. Contrast this with a well-developed body of empirical literature supporting usage of
certain interventions.
A third, related conclusion is that many of the most
common accommodations have few or no experimental
studies directly investigating their ef ﬁcacy. For instance, we
could not locate a single study directly investigating private
room testing accommodations speci ﬁcally in children or ad-
olescents with and without ADHD. Even extended time, the
most common accommodation, has generated fewer than 10
empirical studies directly examining its effects and appro-
priateness in this population. Similarly, we could ﬁnd only a
few experimental studies of any instructional accommoda-
tions. Our fourth and ﬁnal conclusion is that surveys of
students with ADHD, as well as those who work with them,
have repeatedly found ambivalence and dissatisfaction about
accommodations (and the accommodations process) from
many stakeholders. Exact results vary from one survey to
another, and some positive comments are certainly present as
well, but no survey ﬁnds widespread positive perceptions of
the current state of accommodations practice.
These conclusions appear to provide additional support
for the life-course model of ADHD services, in which in-terventions and other strategies are ﬁrst attempted, and ac-
commodations are best viewed as either stop-gap measures
while a student ’s skills undergo intervention (instructional
accommodations may be especially relevant here), or as a
concession made when the student fails to respond suf ﬁ-
ciently to well-implemented, evidence-based interventions.
Health and mental health professionals who diagnose ADHD
should therefore be hesitant to recommend most accom-
modations (as part of Section 504 plans or IEPs) immediately
after a diagnosis, without ensuring that interventions are in
place and have time to work.
We understand that these proposals are easier to state than
to implement. Although it is easy to cite the bene ﬁts of
evidence-based interventions, such interventions are not easily
accessed in every school, because of de ﬁcits in resources and
support as well as weaknesses in knowledge and training. In
addition, even when accommodations fail to lead to better
behavior or higher achievement, they often represent a
genuine commitment to help the student, and so they may be
rationalized as having something like a placebo effect. How-ever, like other forms of overtreatment, educational accom-
modations have the potential to back ﬁre, creating dependency
on supports that —unlike placebo medications —cannot be
used inde ﬁnitely. Extended time for testing, the most com-
mon accommodation, can even lead to students slowing their
rate of work productivity, keeping them from learning time-
management skills. Worse still, the perception of accommo-
dations as “quick ﬁxes”may lead students and their families to
454 www.jaacap.org Journal of the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry
Volume 60 / Number 4 / April 2021LOVETT AND NELSON",paper28.pdf,7
"seek unwarranted accommodations, even through deliberately
exaggerating symptoms; anecdotal reports of this phenome-
non have been noted in high school students,79and in post-
secondary students there is evidence of frequent symptom
exaggeration during ADHD evaluations.80,81
A second implication from our review of the literature is
the need for additional empirical research on the effects ofaccommodations, particularly the ones most commonly
used in current practice. Since effects may depend upon
such factors as the age of students and the subject matter of
classes or examinations, there are many needed studies.
Studies should include outcome variables beyond exami-
nation performance, such as student self-perceptions and
expectations, to further examine the potential harmful (as
well as helpful) effects of accommodations. It is our hope
that the present review might stimulate such work.

An 8-year-old boy is referred for a psychiatric evaluation after
concerns about signi ﬁcant distractibility and impulsive behavior
that have been present for 2 yea rs but have apparently worsened
since the start of third grade. Parent and teacher reports, as well
as clinical observation and record review, all suggest an ADHD
diagnosis. The boy ’s parents inquire about what accommoda-
tions they should ask the school to make for their son. Consistent
with the comprehensive life-cou rse model of care, what should
be done prior to asking the sch ool to modify instruction or
testing for the child?
First, foundational strategies such as parent and teacher
education should be used. Does the patient ’s teacher have
classroom management skills that include making behavioralexpectations clear and enforcing consequences for misbe-
havior consistently? Do the parents and teacher have a system
for communicating regularly to monitor the child ’s behavior
and performance over time?
Second, evidence-based psychosocial interventions should
be attempted, to improve the child ’s skills. Because school is an
area of particular concern, one e ffective school-based psycho-
social intervention for elementary school /C0aged students with
ADHD is a token reinforcement system, whereby the child can
earn tokens for appropriate behavior and loses them for misbe-
havior, and can exchange the tokens periodically for privileges or
other primary reinforcers.Third, if psychosocial interventions have been imple-
mented with ﬁdelity and are insuf ﬁciently effective for this
particular patient, medication can be initiated. Stimulantmedications in particular have shown considerable ef ﬁcacy in
reducing levels of core symptoms in many youths with ADHD.
If the strategies described above do not yield gains, and
particularly if the treatment provider sees evidence that thechild is actually not able to access the educational program
(instruction or assessments) because of ADHD symptoms, a
recommendation for school-based accommodations can beconsidered. These accommodations would be targeted to the
child ’s particular pattern of needs. For instance, if the student
cannot maintain attention suf ﬁciently to complete an exami-
nation, a read-aloud accommodation may be appropriate.
Importantly, even if accommodations are implemented, in-
terventions should continue in the hopes of reducing thechild ’s dependence on accommodations. Moreover, the
child ’s response to any accommodations should be moni-
tored, to examine both logistical feasibility and ef ﬁcacy.
If the provider recommends an accommodation,
relevant laws can be cited; however, more importantly,any letter should include clear evidence showing that the
child meets the formal criter ia for ADHD, is functionally
limited, and is unable to access the educational programat present.

Attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic, and impairing mental health disorder of childhood. Decades
of empirical research has established a strong evidence-based intervention armamentarium for ADHD; however, limitations exist inregards to ef ﬁcacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We provide an overview of select evidence-based interventions for
children and adolescents, highlighting potential approaches to further improving the ef ﬁcacy and effectiveness of these
interventions. We conclude with broader recommendations for interventions, including considerations to moderators and under-explored intervention target areas as well as avenues to improve access and availability of evidence-based interventions through
leveraging underutilized workforces and leveraging technology.

EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR ADHD - AN OVERVIEW
Multiple groups, committees, and professional organizations have
provided the ﬁeld with recommendations for evidence-based
treatment approaches for ADHD. There is clear consensus acrossthese recommendations that pharmacological treatments, notably
stimulant medication, psychosocial treatments, and a combination
of these two approaches have the strongest evidence base. Table1provides a brief overview of the major conclusions of each
guideline for the treatment of ADHD in children. It is clearly
recommended that families should receive psychoeducation
regarding ADHD, and that the evidence-based psychosocialtreatments are behavioral parent training (BPT), behavioralinterventions in classroom and peer settings, and organizational
skills training [ 1–5].
There are inconsistencies among the guidelines that make
broad statements of consensus dif ﬁcult. For instance, there are
differences in precision in recommendations for psychosocial
treatments, with some very broad in scope [ 6] compared to others
with more precise recommendations regarding particular treat-ment types (e.g., BPT [ 2]) and particular populations (e.g., children
under six; [ 5]). Broad suggestions of seeking “psychological ”or
“educational ”treatment is unhelpful in some guidelines and
practice parameters, as there are many approaches that fall underthis category and some are clearly ef ﬁcacious whereas other
approaches commonly deployed do not have evidence of ef ﬁcacy
for ADHD [ 1–4]. There are also differences in the strength of
recommendations, with more contemporary guidelines emphasiz-ing multimodal treatments more so than older guidelines.
However, perhaps most notably, there is not clear consensus
among the recommendations on the best sequence or combina-tion of treatments for ADHD, even though this is a key questionfor most families pursuing treatment for ADHD. It is also important
to note that most guidelines focus on proximal ADHD treatment –
as ADHD is now conceptualized as a life-course persistent disorder
[7], treatment efforts will need to be protracted across time and
appropriate for evolving developmental levels.
EFFORTS AT IMPROVING EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF
PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION FOR ADHD: WHAT DO WE
KNOW AND WHERE DO WE GO?
Given the prominent role of psychosocial, primarily behavioralinterventions, for ADHD, we highlight the evidence for several ofthese key interventions, integrating the literature on improving
efﬁcacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We also discuss
digital therapeutics given the explosion in its availability andpurported ef ﬁcacy for children with ADHD. Following this, we
close with potential broad future directions for psychosocial
treatments for children with ADHD.
Behavioral parent training
Behavioral parent training (BPT) is likely the most well-studied
psychosocial intervention for children ’s mental health disorders,
including for ADHD [ 8]. It serves as the ﬁrst line intervention
approach for younger children with ADHD and is an integral part
of comprehensive intervention approaches for school-age chil-
dren with ADHD. Importantly, BPT is less studied in adolescentswith ADHD. Although parenting is not etiological to ADHD, thereare clear reasons to focus on parenting when supporting a child
with ADHD. Of primary importance is that raising a child with
ADHD is stressful, and not surprisingly, elicits ineffectual parenting
practices (e.g., inconsistent, harsh, lax, overreactive, less

"responsive). As a result, parents often have lower parenting
efﬁcacy/competence, higher levels of coercive management
practices, utilize maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., increased
use of alcohol), and have more negative attributions/perceptionsof their child [ 8]. These parent-level challenges can be addressed,
in part, by supporting parents to utilize more proactive and
effective parenting practices which can help improve functioningfor themselves and ultimately their children. Importantly, the mostcommon comorbidities with ADHD, Oppositional De ﬁant Disorder
[ODD] and Conduct Disorder (CD) are best treated with BPT —
making BPT an essential treatment for the most commondisruptive behavior disorders in childhood [ 8].
BPT is based on operant-conditioning and social learning
theories, with techniques that focus on antecedents (e.g., effective
instructions, rules) and consequences (e.g., active ignoring, time-out from positive reinforcement) of behaviors. This core content is
delivered in a ﬂexible manner with varying formats (e.g., group,
individual) durations (brief vs longer), with or without childinvolvement, delivery (e.g., with or without video-based learning).Moreover, over the past two decades, there have been efforts at
tailoring BPT to meet the needs of speci ﬁc populations (e.g., single
mothers, fathers; Latine; [ 9–12]). These BPT programs, often
referred to as “homegrown ”BPT as compared to commercialized
BPT programs (those that have been more extensively developed,
manualized and are commercially available; e.g., De ﬁant Children[13]) retain the core content of traditional BPT but have
modi ﬁcations to format or additional content that are based on
the needs of the targeted populations. Overall, commercialized
BPT and homegrown BPT have been found to be effective inimproving the functioning of children with ADHD and their
parents [ 14–16]. A recent meta-analysis also suggests sustained
bene ﬁts of BPT over the course of a year on child ADHD
symptoms, parenting behavior, parenting sense of competenceand parental mental health [ 17]. The signi ﬁcance of BPT should be,
however, put into a broader context to appreciate the clinical
bene ﬁts of this intervention. While multiple randomized con-
trolled trials have established the statistical signi ﬁcance of BPT for
ADHD, the effect size for BPT ranges from small to medium effects,
depending upon the outcome [ 18]. This means that for many
outcomes, the effect sizes would be “visible to the naked eye of a
careful observer ”[19]. While there is limited data, only a signi ﬁcant
minority of children are “normalized ”following BPT [ 15].
Collectively, a more nuanced perspective on BPT for ADHDsuggests that it is an evidence-based intervention that can resultin visible improvements on key outcomes. There is room,
however, to improve the potency of BPT. The implications of the
ﬁndings reported above suggest several broad areas for further
investigation. First is to increase access to BPT given the bene ﬁts
of the intervention. Wolraich et al. [ 20] note that there is a lack of
an adequate pool of behavioral and mental health specialists whoTable 1. Review of practice parameters and treatment guidelines for ADHD.

"are available to provide evidence-based psychosocial treatments
for ADHD, including BPT. National data suggest that the majority
of youth with ADHD are receiving no treatment, even when
identi ﬁed, and the lack of BPT treatment is most pronounced in
young children with ADHD [ 21]. Efforts at utilizing technology to
increase the workforce offers novel and promising approaches to
address this issue [ 22].
A second area is to increase the potency of BPT. We believe
there are multiple ways to achieve this goal, with the mostapparent being improving the extent to which parents fully
engage in BPT, given the relation between increased engagement
and improved potency of outcomes [ 23]. It is common for families
of children with ADHD, even those who have enrolled in BPT, tonot initiate treatment or drop out of BPT prior to completion
[9,23]. Given this, there have been notable efforts at improving
engagement to BPT through addressing perceptual (e.g., expecta-tions about BPT), practical (e.g., transportation) and cultural
barriers to treatment prior to BPT [ 10,24] as well as during BPT
[25]. Given that engagement challenges often involve practical
barriers (e.g., transportation, child care, ﬁxed appointment times),
there has been efforts at increasing access through reducing these
barriers such as providing BPT through mobile applications [ 26],
web-based platforms [ 27] and telehealth delivery [ 28,29]. These
efforts have led to improved engagement and associatedoutcomes for families, beyond traditional BPT [ 30]. Engagement
with BPT remains an important area of research, particularly the
extent to which these enhancements to BPT can be readilyapplied in routine settings [ 25,31,32], an understudied empirical
question.
A second and meaningful line of research to improve the potency
of BPT has been focused on improving speci ﬁcity of BPT content by
translating contemporary theories of ADHD into re ﬁnements to BPT.
Van der Oord and Tripp [ 33]), utilizing contemporary motivational
reinforcement-based theories of A DHD, suggest that given altered
reinforcement sensitivity in ADHD, rewards and punishment shouldbe judiciously provided. As an example, they note evidence that
while mild negative punishment (e.g., response-cost, time-out from
positive reinforcement) improves on-task behavior in children withADHD, mild punishment can also lead to more errors on tasks,increased emotionality in children with ADHD, missed learning
opportunities, and lack of task persistence [ 34,35]. These authors
note caution in the use of punishment, especially positive punish-ment (e.g., verbal reprimands), with children with ADHD. Rather,
there should be a focus on rewarding alternative adaptive behaviors
to reduce the need to use punishment. These theory-drivenconsiderations to adapting BPT are important, yet empiricallyunderstudied. As such, the extent to which these ADHD-theory-
adapted BPT results in improved outcomes relative to standard BPT is
not known. Importantly, howev er, some efforts in this area have
resulted in little difference for ADHD-adapted BPT relative tostandard BPT. As an example, in an RCT, the New Forest Parenting
Program (NFPP), which was developed to address underlying
mechanisms of ADHD (self-regulatory and cognitive problems [ 36]
was found to be no better than a standard BPT program and in some
areas less effective (e.g., parental stress, parenting behavior, parent
reports of ADHD symptoms at follow-up) for preschool children withADHD [ 37] .T h e s ed a t as u g g e s tt h ei m p o r t a n c eo fr i g o r o u s l y
evaluating novel approaches that are considered improvements to
BPT to well-established traditional BPT for ADHD.
Overall, the ef ﬁcacy of BPT suggests that this should be
ﬁrst-line
intervention approach for children with ADHD, with signi ﬁcant
and noticeable effects of BPT on both parent- and child-level
outcomes with maintenance of gains over the course of a year.
This statement comes with the caveat that there is room forimprovement in the potency of BPT. As we will discuss in the
future directions section below, greater attention must be given to
dissemination of BPT (and all psychosocial interventions forADHD) within routine systems of care and evaluation of theeffectiveness of these interventions alone and in combination
when delivered within these systems.
Behavioral classroom management
ADHD is largely de ﬁned by challenges in settings such as schools
where behavioral expectations are often demanding of attention
capacity and self-control, and so it is not surprising that many of
the ef ﬁcacious treatments for ADHD have focused on improving
academic functioning and classroom behaviors. Children withADHD are effectively treated with classroom contingency manage-
ment strategies [ 38]. Systematic reviews [ 1,2,4,5,39] as well as
meta-analyses [ 40–42] clearly illustrate that behavioral classroom
management is an ef ﬁcacious treatment for ADHD.
As noted above, behavioral classroom management is an
efﬁcacious treatment for ADHD. Before discussing evidence for
efﬁcacy and effectiveness of behavior classroom management, it
is worth noting approaches that do not strongly support positive
outcomes. In the United States, children with ADHD are eligible for
behavioral classroom management support through Section 504Accommodation plans administered through the Americans withDisabilities Act or through an Individualized Education Program if
the committee on special education determines it is needed.
These policies have provided school-based behavioral supports forstudents with ADHD for over 30 years. However, given that follow-up studies indicate that the long-term educational outcomes for
students with ADHD are modest, at best [ 43–46], it is important to
emphasize that these accommodation plans or individualizededucation programs are only useful if they include effective
interventions and supports for the child or adolescent with ADHD.
Practically speaking, behavioral classroom management
approaches that are effective will include setting clear goals andrules, ensure that the child receives clear feedback on progress
toward meeting goals, and that consequences, typically rewards
and privileges contingent on meeting behavioral goals andfollowing rules, are provided liberally. It is important to note thatpositive behavior support strategies are interwoven into the fabric
of elementary school classrooms - teachers provide rules and
structure for activities, there is praise issued for appropriatebehavior, and schools have standard discipline proceduresincluding of ﬁce referrals or detentions for rule violations. Feed-
back is provided on a regular, if infrequent basis (i.e., on quarterly
report cards). For most children with ADHD this provides areasonable baseline of behavioral classroom management, but
additional strategies and supports are typically needed to make
the overall approach to supporting a child with ADHD moreefﬁcacious.
Children with ADHD typically need much more frequent
behavioral feedback and positive consequences for appropriate
behavior in schools. For that reason, a daily report card is amongthe most ef ﬁcacious positive behavior supports within a classroom
[47,48]. The daily report card has long been used effectively to
treat ADHD, monitor outcomes, and open a daily line of
communication between teachers and the child ’s parent
[49–57], and it is a procedure aligned with a long tradition of
using contingency management with children with disruptive
behavior in general educational settings [ 58] and in special
education settings [ 57
,59,60]. In addition to being among the
most ef ﬁcacious classroom interventions, it is also one of the most
cost effective [ 61].
Recent changes in the ways schools address social, emotional,
and behavioral challenges may promote greater effectiveness ofthe implementation of classroom behavior management strate-
gies. Multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS [ 62] in schools
conceptualize the behavior of children as being within acontinuum, and through regular screening and progress monitor-
ing, provide more intensive intervention, when indicated and for
as long as is needed. Currently MTSS efforts in schools are focusedon academic achievement targets, and there is less emphasis onA. Chacko et al.
3
Translational Psychiatry          (2024) 14:244 ",paper29.pdf,3
"MTSS for behavior [ 63]. However, the MTSS model of screening
and intervention is similar to the single case design approach to
intervention that has been long-used within the ADHD treatment
literature [ 4,5,47]. In this approach, following the collection of
baseline data, behavior classroom management interventions aresystematically introduced to evaluate their effectiveness. Educa-
tors also bene ﬁt from ongoing coaching, support, and monitoring
of progress to promote consistent and protracted use of thesebehavioral interventions [ 64].
Supporting this approach to school-based intervention is a
recent study that evaluated the effectiveness of different
sequences of ADHD treatment [ 65]. In this study, using a
sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART [ 66]),
children were randomly assigned to begin the school year with
one of the two evidence-based treatments for ADHD - a low dose
of stimulant medication or an initial course of behavior therapy(eight parent training sessions and a daily report card intervention
at school). Teachers provided feedback on how the child was
functioning in the classroom, and if there was evidence ofimpaired functioning, the child was then randomly assigned tomore treatment –either a greater dose of the treatment at the
start of the school year, or a other modality. Thus, children could
have a treatment sequence of: (1) medication followed by anincreased dose of medication; (2) medication with behaviortherapy added; (3) behavior therapy followed by an increased
dose of behavior therapy; or (4) behavior therapy followed by
medication. Results were interesting as they illustrated the bestsequence of treatment for reducing discipline referrals and
disruptive behaviors observed in the classroom were those that
started with behavior therapy ﬁrst. Further, the behavior therapy
ﬁrst approaches also cost less to implement across the school year
than the treatment sequences that included medication [ 61].
Importantly, this study of the effectiveness of treatment sequen-
cing spanned an entire school year, improving upon the researchbase of ef ﬁcacy treatments where many studies focused on
shorter time periods. While the Pelham study provides a
foundation for considering combined and sequenced approaches,
far less has been done on the effectiveness of behavioralclassroom approaches when conducted within and supportedentirely by school-staff over the course of multiple school years.
Overall, there is strong support for behavioral classroom
interventions, including the Daily Report Card [ 48,50,67], and it
is strongly recommended that this intervention be initiated for
children with ADHD experiencing classroom-based impairment.
For older children (e.g., middle school, high school), a behavioralcontract may be used to initiated contingency managementacross the multiple classrooms characteristic of this grade level.
Educators and parents should ensure that school-based interven-
tions are implemented consistency and continuously, as school-based behavioral challenges are likely to extend across schoolyears and grade levels.
Organization skills training
Related to their dif ﬁculties staying on task and following the rules
in the classroom setting, children with ADHD have impaired
organization, time management, and planning skills that under-mine their academic abilities and potential. Homework manage-ment and organizational skills have been shown to predict
concurrent GPA and later academic outcomes [ 68,69]. Organiza-
tional skills training (OST) interventions utilize behavioral methodsto teach skills directly to students with ADHD. The trainingprograms often include behavioral management procedures
administered by a counselor, parent, or teacher to reinforce skill
use and progress in treatment. Organizational interventions havelargely targeted middle school to early high school students with
ADHD (ages 10 –14 [ 70]), with sessions focusing on materials
organization, understanding time and time management, andplanning larger assignments. Session frequency and length varywidely from about 10, 60-minute family sessions in a clinic [ 71]t o
40, 2.5-hour student sessions in an after-school setting [ 72].
Multicomponent OST packages lead to improvements in organi-
zational skills, planner use, and adolescent impairment [ 73].
Embedding OST in schools is key to enhancing the reach of
these interventions. Though availability of school personnel to
implement OST varies across districts, current work aims to train
school counselors to implement OST with students with ADHD
[74]. Langberg and colleagues [ 74] found that OST delivered by
school staff led to improvements in organization, time manage-
ment, and planning skills as performance and behavior during
homework based on parent-report. Importantly, these results werefound despite the school counselors receiving only 2 h of trainingin the intervention with no ongoing supervision. Purposefully
limiting training and post-training investment allows for the
examination of treatment effects in the context in which theywould likely be provided —i.e., in schools, by school mental health
providers with little funding for training and ongoing supervision.
Toward the same goal of increasing the sustainability of OSTwithin schools, investigators are developing online tools to assistschool staff with OST implementation at low to no cost [ 75].
Psychosocial treatments for children with ADHD have primarily
been researched in elementary-age youth, and early work indeveloping organizational skills interventions addressed this gapby upwardly extending treatments to middle school age youth. As
the evidence accumulated that such interventions were ef ﬁca-
cious among children with ADHD in middle school [ 1,2], further
developmental extension was clearly justi ﬁed [76]. adapted their
OST program developed for middle schoolers to pilot with high
school students with ADHD. Pilot data demonstrated feasibilityand indicated that high schoolers may need about 50 sessions tobene ﬁt from the OST program. In the full-scale randomized clinical
trial [ 77], high schoolers attended an average of 40 brief OST
sessions while their caregivers attended an average of 4behavioral parent training sessions. Compared to the controlgroup, bene ﬁcial effects of treatment were found on parent-
reported academic functioning and organizational skills, and no
signi ﬁcant effects on grades, teacher-reported, or self-reported
outcomes were found. Results are promising, and much morework is needed to support the academic functioning of older
adolescents with ADHD.
Digital therapeutics
Of all the available non-medication treatments, this category is the
only one that features protocols patented by the US Patent andTrademark Of ﬁce (USPTO) and cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD. It is also the most
controversial, with competing consensus statements concluding
that these types of interventions have proven effective vs. provenineffective [ 78], millions of dollars in ﬁnes for false advertising [ 78],
and a perceived disconnect between benchmarks for effective-
ness between the FDA and professional organizations that
evaluate psychosocial treatments for children [ 79]. Overall, there
appears to be evidence for small bene ﬁts of cognitive training on
reducing inattentive symptoms, and potentially overall ADHD
symptoms [ 80]. However, we contend that omnibus meta-analytic
effect sizes are fundamentally uninterpretable in the context ofcognitive training/digital therapeutics because the treatments that
fall under this general umbrella feature wide variations in
neurocognitive/neurological training targets, conceptual modelsof neurocognition that de ﬁne these intended training targets,
success/failure to meaningfully engage and improve the intended
training target(s), and technologies employed to ‘hit’the intended
target(s). Therefore, what these treatments share are moreperipheral features, rather than core mechanistic features
necessary to meet meta-analytic assumptions. Even interventions
given the same, more speci ﬁc label (e.g., “working memory
training ”) vary widely in their approach, conceptual basis, andA. Chacko et al.
4
Translational Psychiatry          (2024) 14:244 ",paper29.pdf,4
"success/failure at engaging their mechanistic target as shown
previously [ 81]. It will be important for the ﬁeld to evaluate each
intervention on its own merits because these protocols generally
share very little with each other except for the use of a seriousgames approach [ 82] to engaging children in treatment.
Several neurocognitive training protocols have been developed
and tested for children with ADHD; we brie ﬂy review three of the
most prominent: EndeavorRX, CogMed, and Central ExecutiveTraining (Cenextra; an intervention developed by one of the co-authors). All three of these approaches are computerized digital
therapeutics that include gaming elements and adaptive changes
in dif ﬁculty. EndeavorRX trains cognitive attention abilities [ 83],
Cenextra trains the ‘working ’components of working memory [ 84]
and CogMed is intended to improve attention and working
memory abilities [ 85], though clinical trial and meta-analytic
evidence indicates that CogMed successfully engages short-termmemory but not working memory abilities [ 81,86,87].
In terms of ef ﬁcacy, EndeavorRX showed early promise in pilot/
uncontrolled studies given generally favorable feasibility, accept-ability, and engagement data [ 83]. In addition, EndeavorRX showed
potential for reductions in parent-reported ADHD symptoms in
proof-of-concept and open-label trials with children with ADHD
[88,89]. However, the only controlled trial to date [ 83] demonstrated
that these potential reductions were likely attributable to placeboeffects –that is, Endeavor RX failed to show superior improvements
in ADHD behavioral symptoms relative to a control condition (a
spelling game). Evans et al. [ 79]c o n c l u d e dt h a t “there is no evidence
that using this game will result in any bene ﬁt in terms of their
functioning and presenting problems. ”(p. 125).
Cenextra also showed early promise in a head-to-head
comparison with behavioral parent training (BPT) indicatingfavorable feasibility, acceptability, and engagement data. Cenextra
was superior to BPT for improving working memory ( d=1.06) and
reducing objectively-assessed hyperactivity ( d=0.74), and equiva-
lent to BPT for reducing parent-reported ADHD symptoms at post-treatment [ 90]. These bene ﬁts were largely con ﬁrmed in an RCT
comparing Cenextra with an active, credible digital therapeutic
control called Inhibitory Control Training (ICT; [ 84]). Evidence
suggesting improved functional outcomes is also emerging, andincludes superior improvements relative to both BPT and ICT on
masked teacher perceptions of organizational skills, academic
success, impulse control, and academic productivity 1 –
2 months
after treatment ended [ 91,92].
Similar to EndeavorRX and Cenextra, Cogmed showed consider-
able promise in early trials, and is arguably the most extensivelystudied neurocognitive training program. Results from meta-analytic reviews and RCTs, however, suggest that CogMed does
not improve working memory, but rather improves select
components of short-term memory (meta-analytic d=0.63;
[81,86,93,94]. This is an important limitation for at least two
reasons: First, most children with ADHD do not have de ﬁcits in
short term memory (20 –38% impairment rates) despite the
majority having impairments in working memory (75 –81%;
[95–97]). Second, short-term memory abilities are not signi ﬁcantly
associated with ADHD symptoms in most studies [ 81,95], which
suggests limited potential for downstream improvements inADHD behavioral symptoms. Indeed, conclusions from multiplemeta-analytic reviews suggest that bene ﬁts on ADHD behavioral
symptoms from CogMed are generally limited to unblinded
parent ratings [ 81,93]. Notably, however, a more recent meta-
analysis published by the developer of CogMed suggestssigni ﬁcant, small bene ﬁts for reducing inattention ( d=0.37;
[98]), though the extent to which this was driven by unblinded
parent ratings was unclear.
A key bene ﬁt of digital therapeutics –and ‘software as
medicine ’in general –is that they have the potential to
continually adapt and improve based on real-time patient data.Thus, it is possible that interventions that are not showing thebehavioral/functional bene ﬁts we had hoped for now could begin
to do so in the future. Thus, we highlight some key areas for
improvement based on conceptual models and the limited
available literature on moderators of cognitive training ef ﬁcacy
for children with ADHD. First, there is a need to maximize dosage .
In the context of digital therapeutics, ‘dosage ’refers to the
quantity and quality of time spent actively engaging with the
training exercises. Most existing protocols have been studied overa relatively limited time frame of 4 –10 weeks of training, with a
total training time of about 10 –
12 h across intervention protocols
[83,84,99]. It is possible that this level of training is insuf ﬁcient for
producing large enough neurocognitive improvements to trans-late into meaningful –and statistically detectable –gains in
downstream behavioral/functional outcomes, suggesting the
need for more intensive/longer duration training.
An option closely related to maximizing dosage is increasing the
speci ﬁcity of the neurocognitive training target(s). Although
training a variety of neurocognitive functions is appealing at face
value, meta-analytic evidence indicates that such protocolsproduce smaller near-transfer effects than protocols that focuson a single neurocognitive training target [ 81]. It is presumed that
the reason for this ﬁnding is that the more different cognitive
‘muscles ’that we are trying to train, the less time we can spend on
any one of those ‘muscles ’. Thus, it appears likely that maximizing
efﬁcacy will require separate protocols for each neurocognitive
function that is impaired in ADHD, combined with a ‘personalized
medicine ’approach in which each child ’s neurocognitive pro ﬁle is
estimated at pre-treatment, and then a treatment plan is
developed to target each of their identi ﬁed weaknesses. We must
leverage basic science to link training targets with behavioral/functional outcomes . Related to dosage and speci ﬁcity issues is the
idea of matching neurocognitive training targets with the speci ﬁc
outcome(s) of interest. Stated bluntly, neurocognitive training is
not likely to be helpful if we are training neurocognitive abilitiesthat are not robustly linked with the reason(s) a child presents fortreatment. On the other hand, neurocognitive training protocols
have great potential if they are able to produce robust
improvements in their training target, and if that training target
is robustly associated with the observable behaviors/functionaloutcomes we are trying to improve. A ﬁnal area that shows
promise for improving the ef ﬁcacy of digital therapeutic
interventions is augmentation: Combining them with existingtreatments to (potentially) produce synergistic and/or augmenta-
tive bene ﬁts. This area of inquiry is in its infancy, and currently
shows more conceptual promise than actual bene ﬁts [100].
FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN IMPROVING EFFICACY AND
EFFECTIVENESSThis brief review of psychosocial treatments for ADHD illustratesthe robust evidence in support of these interventions. Importantly,
there is no panacea or magic bullet for ADHD; the interventions
reviewed herein have notable limitations and response tointerventions vary. As such, there continues to be efforts at
reﬁning existing approaches and developing novel approaches to
treating the complex presentation of ADHD. We highlight herewhat we believe are key future directions, broadly speaking, inimproving the effectiveness and ef ﬁcacy of treatment for ADHD.
These fall under two broad areas: future directions in treatments
and future directions in service delivery of these treatments.
Future directions in treatment for ADHD
Moderators of treatment effects . Much of the intervention
literature has focused on static factors or social addresses (termsthat describe rather than explain; e.g., marital status, child age;) as
factors, largely because these are measures of convenience. Efforts
toward using dynamic factors have shed light on what works for
whom and can further re ﬁne an intervention to increase potency.A. Chacko et al.
5
Translational Psychiatry          (2024) 14:244 ",paper29.pdf,5
"As an example, in BPT, parent-level variables (e.g., parenting stress
[101]) have been shown to moderate BPT engagement and
outcomes, suggesting that future re ﬁnements to BPT that more
directly address parental stress may increase the potency of BPT.Such efforts should be employed across all psychosocialinterventions for ADHD. Importantly, as we have discussed
elsewhere [ 8,102], efforts should go beyond variable-centered
approaches (e.g., child age, parent stress) toward holistic, person-and/or family-centered approaches (the clustering of variablesthat more fully represent a child/parent/family). As an example,
Dale et al. [ 103] employed a person-centered approach to create
subgroups of families based on the intersection of multiple parent,child, and family factors to understand response to BPT forfamilies of preschool children with ADHD. Three distinct family
proﬁles emerged, with data suggesting differential response for
families with high stress, elevated parental anxiety, and elevatedparental depression. These typological approaches better re ﬂect
reality- people are more accurately re ﬂected as a complex
intersection of variables rather than just any one variable- andtaking this approach may better result in a nuanced under-standing of response to treatment and further inform treatment
for types of people and families.
ADHD is complex and presentations vary. It is not uncommon
for children and adolescents with ADHD to also have signi ﬁcant
difﬁculties outside of core symptoms of ADHD (e.g., emotion
dysregulation, sleep disturbances) that may moderate treatment
response. As an example, ADHD is frequently associated withemotional regulation challenges, with studies suggesting that the
vast majority of children with ADHD (i.e., 75%) have some
symptoms of emotion dysregulation, with 25% having severeemotion dysregulation [ 104]. In fact, children with ADHD and
severe emotion dysregulation are more likely to have complex
presentations, cross-situational impairments and severe psycho-
pathology [ 105]. Interestingly, there are few rigorous randomized
controlled trials evaluating the effects of psychosocial interven-tions for emotion dysregulation in children with ADHD [ 106].
These and other moderators may best be evaluated through novel
approaches such as individual participant data meta-analysis[107]. Addressing the needs of youth with ADHD and their families
will require going beyond addressing core symptoms of ADHD. In
fact, we have long argued that these types of functional
impairments (e.g., academic, social functioning) should be thetargets for ADHD treatment rather than ADHD symptoms [ 8].
Novel intervention targets . The presentation of ADHD at key
developmental periods/tasks may pose signi ﬁcant challenges for
affected youth and their families- necessitating novel targets of
intervention. An example of this is the transition to learning to
drive. Adolescents are the riskiest drivers on the roadway, overall;if an adolescent has ADHD they are signi ﬁcantly more at risk for
negative driving outcomes including accidents, accidents that
cause injury, and fatalities [ 108,109]. The period of time when
individuals with ADHD are learning to drive may therefore be acritical, and also opportune time to initiate intervention. A recent
RCT with adolescents with ADHD [ 110], evaluated a specially
designed computerized simulated-driving program with feedbackand found reduced problematic driving as compared with acontrol program. During real-world driving in the year after
training, the rate of collisions and near-collisions was lower in the
intervention group. These efforts highlight the potential ofpsychosocial interventions for addressing impairments inherentwith developmental transitions for youth with ADHD. Related
work suggests that intervening with adolescents at the transition
to middle school and high school with intensive summer “bridge ”
programs may be a useful approach with high levels of
engagement [ 111]. Future work should focus on embedding
treatment efforts into other developmental tasks/transitions/tasks(e.g., start of preschool or initiation of employment).Future directions in service delivery
ADHD is now very clearly understood to persist throughout
development and into adulthood and there has rightfully been a
shift toward a chronic care model [ 7]. Given this, attention must be
given to developing integrated, consistently available and long-itudinal approaches embedded in routine service systems such
that children, adolescents (and even adults) with ADHD and their
families can receive appropriate care. Unfortunately, availability
and access to evidence-based interventions are limited. Recentstudies suggest that only 31% of families of children with ADHD
receive BPT [ 21] and just 32% receive behavioral classroom
management [ 112]. Given this, we highlight herein issues related
to increasing availability and access to evidence-based psychoso-cial treatment for ADHD- important goals to help close the
science-to-service-gap in ADHD. More speci ﬁcally, we brie ﬂy
highlight efforts on (1) leveraging the existing workforce, and (2)using technology to deliver evidence-based psychosocial
treatments.
Leveraging existing workforces . In light of mental health workforce
shortages ( https://data.hrsa.gov/topics/health-workforce/workforce-
projections ) new models of care will need to utilize and expand
existing, but underdeveloped, non-professional and paraprofes-sional workforces [ 31,32]. One example of a sustainable, scalable
model of care is the Family Peer Advocate (FPA) ADHD Model [ 25].
FPAs are part of a national family support model of current and
former parent/caregivers of children with identi ﬁed mental health
needs who provide a range of services, including parenting skills
training, emotional support, education about mental health services,
and direct advocacy [ 30]. FPA-services are ﬂexibly delivered in a
variety of parent-identi ﬁed settings (e.g., parent ’s homes, commu-
nity settings) and often connect and engage parents with key
service settings/providers (e.g., schools, primary care, mental health
clinics), reducing the systemic barriers associated with traditionalservice delivery models. Moreover, FPAs have many sharedexperiences with the families they serve including personal
experience with providing care and navigating the service system
for children with mental health challenges, often within the samecommunity as those they serve. As a result, FPA care is associatedwith high acceptability ratings and increased engagement [ 113].
This FPA Model appears to be especially effective in reaching
ethnically diverse families from socioeconomically disadvantagedbackgrounds [ 30,113]. Emerging data suggest that FPAs can reliably
and effectively deliver BPT for youth with ADHD [ 25], suggesting
that this and other workforce (e.g., ADHD Coaches) should beleveraged in order to increase availability and access to evidence-based psychosocial interventions for ADHD.
The idea of leveraging the existing workforce also applies to
school settings. The MTSS intervention framework, which embedsintervention in schools into universal, targeted, and indicatedapproaches is an example of a potential means of re-allocating
professional time and expertise. Rather than waiting for school
psychologists and special educators to get involved only when thechild is considered for special education, a MTSS approach might
utilize the expertise of these pr ofessionals to consult with the
general education teacher on how to implement positive behaviorsupports for a child with ADHD. In this way, intervention isimplemented quicker, in the setting where the initial impairment is
identi ﬁed, by existing school professionals [ 56,114].
Use of technology . Technology-based approaches to delivering
evidence-based interventions have the potential to revolutionize
mental health service access and delivery across multiple mental
health disorders [ 115]. Online self-directed BPT approaches are
potentially more feasible, affordable, and acceptable, can have
signi ﬁcant reach to include traditionally underserved populations,
and are readily scalable and sustainable [ 116,117]. Over 13 studies
have recently been conducted demonstrating that online BPT canA. Chacko et al.

"improve child behavioral outcomes. Importantly, a recently
published trial compared Triple P Online (TPO; an evidence-
based, commercially available, self-directed online BPT) to a face-
to-face (F2F) therapist-delivered Triple P for preschool childrenwith disruptive behavior problems [ 118]. This large randomized
controlled trial found that TPO was non-inferior to F2F Triple P on
observed and parent-reported child behavior, with clinically
meaningful effect sizes. This study, combined with several otherstudies [ 27,119,120] demonstrate the effectiveness of online BPT
in general and speci ﬁcally for ADHD. Technology is increasingly
being utilized in practice settings (e.g., ADHD Care Assistant in
primary care [ 121]; Online Daily Report Card in schools [ 122]) to
increase access to evidence-based psychosocial interventions.Concerted efforts and rigorous empirical investigation will be
necessary to further determine the effectiveness of these
approaches. Importantly, while there is high potential for suchtechnology-delivered approaches, engagement to these formats
will remain important to address [ 123].
CONCLUSIONS
ADHD is a prevalent, pervasive, chronic and impairing disorder that
necessitates early, integrated, continuous interventions over a child ’s
development. Fortunately, several psychosocial interventions areavailable that address key functional impairments in children and
adolescents with ADHD. Given the complex presentation of ADHD,
novel approaches to address both underlying pathophysiologicalmechanisms associated with ADHD (e.g., working memory) as well
as domains closely impacted in those with ADHD (e.g., emotion
regulation) and key developmental tasks (e.g., driving) are emergingareas in ADHD intervention science. Efforts to improve the ef ﬁcacy
of psychosocial interventions remain important as the acute bene ﬁts
of these interventions do not result in normalized functioning for
many youth and there remains an under-appreciation for whomthese interventions are most impactful. Likely most pressing is thetranslation of the intervention science to improve outcomes for the
millions of youth affected by ADHD, the science-to-service gap is
prominent; many children who can bene ﬁt from evidence-based
psychosocial interventions do not receive them. Improving accessand availability of evidence-based psychosocial interventions
remains critical to ensure that the signi ﬁcant efforts made over
decades in developing and evaluating interventions for ADHD resultin population-level bene ﬁts for youth with ADHD.

This meta-analysis investigated the effects of computerized cognitive training (CCT) on clinical, neuropsychological and academic
outcomes in individuals with attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The authors searched PubMed, Ovid, and Web of
Science until 19th January 2022 for parallel-arm randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using CCT in individuals with ADHD. Random-
effects meta-analyses pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) between CCT and comparator arms. RCT quality was assessedwith the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool (PROSPERO: CRD42021229279). Thirty-six RCTs were meta-analysed, 17 of which evaluated
working memory training (WMT). Analysis of outcomes measured immediately post-treatment and judged to be “probably blinded ”
(PBLIND; trial n=14) showed no effect on ADHD total (SMD =0.12, 95%CI[ −0.01 to −0.25]) or hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms
(SMD=0.12, 95%[ −0.03 to −0.28]). These ﬁndings remained when analyses were restricted to trials ( n:5–13) with children/
adolescents, low medication exposure, semi-active controls, or WMT or multiple process training. There was a small improvement in
inattention symptoms (SMD =0.17, 95%CI[0.02 –0.31]), which remained when trials were restricted to semi-active controls
(SMD=0.20, 95%CI[0.04 –0.37]), and doubled in size when assessed in the intervention delivery setting ( n=5, SMD =0.40, 95%
CI[0.09 –0.71]), suggesting a setting-speci ﬁc effect. CCT improved WM (verbal: n=15, SMD =0.38, 95%CI[0.24 –0.53]; visual-spatial:
n=9, SMD =0.49, 95%CI[0.31 –0.67]), but not other neuropsychological (e.g., attention, inhibition) or academic outcomes (e.g.,
reading, arithmetic; analysed n:5–15). Longer-term improvement (at ~6-months) in verbal WM, reading comprehension, and ratings
of executive functions were observed but relevant trials were limited in number ( n:5–7). There was no evidence that multi-process
training was superior to working memory training. In sum, CCT led to shorter-term improvements in WM, with some evidence that
verbal WM effects persisted in the longer-term. Clinical effects were limited to small, setting speci ﬁc, short-term effects on
inattention symptoms.

INTRODUCTION
Attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelop-
mental condition characterized by developmentally-inappropriate,persistent, pervasive and impairing inattention and/or hyperactiv-
ity/impulsivity symptoms [ 1]. ADHD medications, particularly
psychostimulants, provide both clinically signi ﬁcant symptomatic
relief and reduction of impairment, at least in the short term [ 2–6],
and are recommended as part of multi-modal treatment strategies
alongside psycho-social therapies (e.g., parent training) and/or
psychoeducation programs [ 7].
Computerized cognitive training (CCT) has also been investi-
gated as a treatment option for those with ADHD. This is
motivated by the notion that ADHD is potentially the result ofweaknesses in neuropsychological processes thought to mediate
causal pathways between originating causes (i.e., genes andenvironment) and symptom expression [ 6]. Indeed, at the group
level, individuals with ADHD typically perform worse than
neurotypical individuals on computerized neuropsychological
measures of a wide-range of cognitive processes, especially motorand interference inhibition, sustained attention and vigilance,switching, working memory (WM), and time perception [ 6,8].
Neuroimaging evidence suggests these abnormalities are under-
pinned by structural and functional alterations across a wide rangeof cortical and subcortical brain circuits [ 6,9,10]. However, the
search for a neuropsychologically-based intervention for ADHD
is complicated by several factors. First, neuropsychological

"heterogeneity, because different individuals may be affected by
deﬁcits in different cognitive processes and brain networks [ 6].
Second, the lack of correlation between treatment related
changes in ADHD symptoms and improvements in neuropsycho-logical functioning [ 2,11]. Third, the overlap of neurophysiological
proﬁles between ADHD and other conditions (e.g., learning
disabilities, conduct disorder, and oppositional de ﬁant disorder)
[2].
CCT programs are designed to target relevant brain systems,
strengthen cognitive skills and processes, and therefore reduce
ADHD symptoms and associated impairment. To do this, they aim
to exploit the brain ’s inherent neuroplasticity [ 8,12,13]. They
usually target one or more cognitive processes (e.g., motorinhibition, interference inhibition, sustained attention, and/or WM)
via an adaptive protocol (i.e., task dif ﬁcultly increases as
performance improves) to enhance and promote longer-termneuroplastic changes [ 8]. On behalf of the European ADHD
Guidelines Group (EAGG), we assessed the ef ﬁcacy of CCT for
ADHD in two meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials - onepublished in 2013 (Sonuga-Barke et al. 2013) [ 14] and an update in
2015 (Cortese et al. 2015) [ 15]. To address the paucity of well-
blinded outcomes, both meta-analyses estimated effect sizes
across the range of degrees of blinding –i.e., comparing effects
from outcomes we judged to be most proximal (MPROX) to the
intervention setting (and therefore the likely least blinded, e.g.,
parent rating in a home-delivered intervention) and outcomes we
judged to be probably blinded (PBLIND; i.e., the most blinded
outcome assessor). Interestingly, in Cortese et al. (2015) [ 15],
statistically signi ﬁcant moderate improvements in MPROX mea-
sures of ADHD total and inattentive symptoms dropped substan-tially to marginal or non-signi ﬁcant levels with PBLIND measures.
This is consistent with the notion that MPROX ratings are
potentially subject to outcome assessor bias. Further, interven-
tions targeting multiple cognitive processes showed encouragingeffects, but analyses were mainly based on non-PBLIND outcomes.Finally, laboratory measures of visual or verbal WM showed
signi ﬁcant small-to-moderate improvements. Other meta-analyses
reported similarly small improvements in ADHD symptoms [ 16,17]
and neuropsychological functions [ 17–19], but these included
randomized and non-randomized trials [ 17], individuals with and
without an ADHD diagnosis or who met cut-off on validated
questionnaire measures [ 16], only four trials [ 16,18], or collapsed
computerized with non-computerized or multi-modal cognitive
training [ 19], all of which limit the interpretability of their
ﬁndings.
Because of the relatively small number of high-quality trials with
PBLIND outcomes at that time, our prior meta-analyses wereunable to provide a solid estimate of the ef ﬁcacy of CCT, an
analysis of whether certain intervention types were better than
others, or whether they improved different neuropsychologicaland academic outcomes. However, since Cortese et al. [ 15], which
included 16 RCTs, there have been a considerable number of new
RCTs published, many with larger samples, well-controlled designs
and blinded outcomes. Therefore, we report an updatedsystematic review and meta-analysis that allowed us to focus on
ADHD symptom improvement using PBLIND measures as our
primary outcome. We also address several outstanding questionsabout different neuropsychological and academic outcomes witha greater degree of granularity of analysis. We were especially
interested to further test, using PBLIND outcomes, the provisional
ﬁnding derived from non-PBLIND analyses that multi-process
training (MPT) is superior to single process training [ 15]. We also
addressed the issue of the setting of measurement. This is because
in our prior analysis PBLIND outcomes were mainly measured in a
setting different from the intervention setting (e.g., teacher ratings
of school-related behaviours with a home-based intervention),
which confounds the blinded status of ratings with the setting of
intervention delivery, meaning that PBLIND outcomes could beindexing the issue of generalisation, not just outcome assessorbias. Our update addressed this issue through a sensitivity analysis
that included only trials with PBLIND outcomes that were
measured in the intervention setting. Finally, and importantly, to
extend the analyses by Cortese et al. [ 15], we aimed to include
participants of all ages, to capture the growing interest in studiesin pre-school and adult samples with ADHD.

We included parallel-arm RCTs with participants of any age thathad a clinical ADHD, or equivalent hyperkinetic syndrome,
diagnosis as de ﬁned by DSM-III/ICD-9 onwards (any subtype/
presentation) or were above cut-off on validated ADHD ratingscales, regardless of the presence of common-comorbidities. CCTsmust have been implemented using fully computer-based
procedures with an adaptive component –i.e., training dif ﬁculty
increased as performance improved. Eligible comparator armswere semi-active (non-adaptive CCT), non-active (treatment asusual [TAU], wait list control [WLC]), or placebo pill. Where trials
had two comparator conditions (e.g., WLC and training control
as well as the active treatment) the condition representing themost rigorous control was selected (e.g., attention control over a
WLC). All RCTs must have been peer-reviewed and published in an
academic journal, and reported a validated outcome measure ofADHD symptoms, neuropsychological processes, and/or academicoutcomes. We excluded RCTs with participants with ADHD with a
rare comorbidity (e.g., Fragile X syndrome) that was used as a trial
inclusion criterion (i.e., all participants had that comorbidity), orwhen CCT was only delivered in combination with or adjunct toanother distinctive planned active treatment that was adminis-
tered as part of the trial (e.g., parent training, neurofeedback, or
ADHD medication plus cognitive training).
Information sources
We searched PubMed (MEDLINE), OVID (PsycInfo, Medline,
Embase +Embase Classic), and Web of Science (science citation
index expanded, Biological abstracts, Biosis, Food science and
technology abstracts) until 19th January 2022 using variations of
terms for ADHD, RCTs, and cognitive training (see Supplement).Database searches were supplemented by hand searching ofpublished relevant systematic reviews or meta-analyses or of
references in individual papers.
Selection, data collection, risk of bias procedures
Two authors (SJW, VP) independently i) screened all article titles
and abstracts; ii) read the full text of articles that passed title/
abstract screening to determine ﬁnal inclusion; iii) extracted
relevant data (see Data Items section below) and iv) assessed all
eligible reports (i.e., all peer-reviewed publications from eligible
RCTs) with the Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool [ 22]. The RoB tool was
used to evaluate each RCT across 5 domains (i.e., randomisationprocess; deviations from intended interventions; missing outcome
data; measurement of the outcome; selection of the reported
result), with signalling questions used to evaluate each domain ashaving either “low risk ”,“some concerns ”,o r “high risk ”of bias
relating to a rater
’s con ﬁdence in the reported results. The overall
RoB for each RCT was derived from the highest (i.e., most severe)
RoB level in any of the ﬁve domains. In some cases, the same
outcome from an RCT was reported in several papers that had
different sample sizes. In these cases, we selected data from the
outcome based on the largest sample size only. Authors weresystematically contacted for unpublished information and data (atS.J. Westwood et al.
1403
Molecular Psychiatry (2023) 28:1402 – 1414",paper3.pdf,2
"least two e-mail contacts separated by at least two to three
weeks). ESB and SC resolved disagreements.
Data extraction
Means and standard deviations at all available time points wereextracted from validated rating scales/subscales that directly
measured ADHD total symptoms o r sub-dimensions (hyperac-
tivity/impulsivity, inattention ) or ADHD-relevant neuropsycho-
logical outcomes, and academic outcomes. Consistent withprevious EAGG protocols, if multiple ADHD outcomes were
reported for each assessor, we selected the one for analysis
based on the following hierarchy; i) ADHD Rating Scale [ 23], ii)
Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale (SNAP) ADHD (anyversion) [ 24,25], iii) Conners ’rating scale (any version; ADHD-
Index or DSM-subscales) (for list of versions, see 28), iv) or other
ADHD scales. If such diagnostic criteria-based measures wereunavailable, alternatives incl uding ratings of ADHD behaviours
were selected with the following order; i) Conners ’non-DSM
subscales; ii) Rutter Scale (hyperactivity subscale) [ 26]o r
Strengths and Dif ﬁculties Questionnaire (hyperactivity/inatten-
tion items) [ 27]; and iii) Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL;
attention problems) [ 28]. In an extension of EAGG protocols, in
trials with adult participants, s elf-ratings were allowed in the
p l a c eo fp a r e n to rt e a c h e rr a t i n g s( when applicable). Self-ratings
were not selected in trials with children/adolescents as this age
group were judged to be relatively less reliable and may
underestimate ADHD severity [ 29].
For ADHD-related outcomes we distinguished MPROX from
PBLIND ratings. MPROX were ratings from individuals judged to be
most proximal to the intervention, which were typically leastblinded to intervention allocation (e.g., parents if home-based;teachers if school-based; investigators or clinicians if lab or clinic-
based; or self-ratings by adults regardless of intervention setting).
PBLIND outcomes were the most blinded outcome whereassessors were judged to be probably unaware of treatmentallocation. We judged an outcome assessor to be PBLIND if they
were a) distal from the intervention setting, b) independent
coders rating in the intervention setting, or c) could be blinded bydesign even if proximal to the treatment setting (e.g., blindedparent if home-based with a non-adaptive CCT control arm).
Where multiple PBLIND outcomes were available, we selected the
one more distal to the treatment setting (e.g., teacher if home-based; parent if school-based) or an independent coder. Outcome
assessors were judged to not be PBLIND if the trial design
prevented concealment of group allocation (e.g., trials with a WLC,TAU, or treatment control) or there was evidence that blindingbroke during the trial (e.g., authors con ﬁrmed blinding integrity
failed either in the manuscript or via personal communication).
MPROX was by de ﬁnition available for all trials that met the
inclusion criteria, while PBLIND was only available for some trials.In some trials, MPROX and PBLIND outcomes were based on the
same assessment (i.e., where there was only one outcome
measure, and the assessor was probably blinded).
Statistical analysis
For ADHD symptoms, we analysed MPROX and PBLIND outcomes,but our primary analyses were PBLIND outcomes because theyprovide a more robust and bias-free estimate of CCT effects. For
other outcomes (i.e., ratings of executive function and academic
outcomes), we report MPROX outcomes if suf ﬁcient (i.e., 5 trials or
more) PBLIND trials were not available. Our primary outcome wasPBLIND outcomes of ADHD symptoms (total combined) measured
at the ﬁrst time point after the ﬁnal CCT session (i.e., post-
assessment). We also report PBLIND assessments of inattentionand hyperactivity/Impulsivity symptoms separately. Other out-
comes were neuropsychological and academic outcomes at post-
assessment or longer-term follow-up ( ≥3-months after the ﬁnal
CCT session). Given the variety of neuropsychological/cognitiveoutcome measures, wherever possible, we took the pragmatic
decision to group outcomes together that we judged to tap the
same or similar core constructs, with judgments informed by
factor analyses and meta-analytic evidence where possible[6,19,30]. Where multiple measures were available for a single
outcome (as was sometimes the case for laboratory measures), the
measure most frequently reported across all included trials was
selected for analysis. If multiple longer-term follow-up assess-
ments were reported, we selected the outcome measured at thetimepoint most frequently assessed across the included trials.
Effect size estimates were based on standardized mean
differences (SMDs), which were calculated as mean baseline- topost-assessment (or follow-up) change in the intervention groupminus the mean baseline- to post-assessment (or follow-up)
change in the control group divided by the pooled baseline
standard deviation with Hedges ’gsmall sample bias adjustment
[31,32]. We conducted random effects models meta-analyses for
all outcomes at all available time points (i.e., baseline, post-
assessment, and follow-up). Outcome domains were analysed onlyifﬁve or more relevant RCTs were available per outcome, in order
to be consistent with previous EAGG meta-analyses [ 15,33,34]
and to reduce between-SMD heterogeneity [ 35]. SMDs were
combined using the inverse variance method [ 31,36], and the
presence of between-SMD heterogeneity was tested using Q–i.e.,
chi-squared test –and the magnitude of true heterogeneity
relative to random heterogeneity was estimated using the I
2
statistic [ 31].
We conducted pre-speci ﬁed sensitivity analyses where at least
ﬁve relevant trials met inclusion criteria. Separate analyses were
conducted that included only trials where: (i) there was a semi-active comparator; ii) only a minority (i.e., <30%) of participantswere receiving medication; iii) only WM was targeted; iv) multiple
cognitive processes were targeted; v) participants were prese-
lected based on impairment in the trained cognitive domain (e.g.,WM, attention, inhibition); vi) with children/adolescents (<18-years-old); vii) with adults (>18-years); or viii) PBLIND assessment
was conducted in the intervention setting. We ran pre-speci ﬁed
meta-regressions with the predictors: mean age (in trials withchildren/ adolescents only) or overall RoB (RoB de ﬁned as low,
some concerns, or high according to the Cochrane RoB 2.0 Tool)
[22]. Post-hoc meta-regressions with publication year as a
predictor also tested whether SMD sizes reduced as study rigourimproved over time. To conduct a meta-regression, there had to
be at least 10 relevant trials per predictor. All the above analyses
were pre-speci ﬁed in our protocol. We also carried out three
additional exploratory (not pre-speci ﬁed) analyses in response to
Reviewer comments. For the ﬁrst, we conducted post-hoc
sensitivity analyses excluding trials that were funded by compa-
nies with a commercial interest in the outcome of the RCT (i.e.,Akili Interactive Labs Ltd, Kollins et al., 2020 [ 37]; Cogmed,
Klingberg et al., 2005, Sandberg & McAuley 2021 [ 38,39];
NeuroCog Solutions Pty Ltd [Australia], Johnstone et al., 2012
[40]; NeuroScouting, Meyer et al., 2020 [ 41]; Sincrolab, Medina
et al., 2021 [ 42]). The ﬁndings did not change when these studies
were excluded. For the second, we analysed the PBLIND outcomes
recorded most proximally to the intervention setting. For the third,we added relevant outcomes from a paper by Ko ﬂer et al. (2020)
[43] which compared two cognitive training interventions -
Inhibitory Control Training (ICT) versus Central Executive Training
(CET) –and so was judged not to meet our inclusion criteria.
However, it was pointed out by the Reviewer (and con ﬁrmed by
M. Ko ﬂer, via personal communication, 7th January 2023) that the
ICT was designed as the comparator arm and CET the treatment
arm for ADHD symptom outcomes and vice versa for motorinhibition outcomes.
Finally, publication bias was assessed using Egger ’s regression
test of small study effects and was carried out only for signi ﬁcant
results with all trials included.S.J. Westwood et al.

RESULTS
Of the 359 non-duplicate reports found, 233 were removed at
title and abstract screening, leaving 136 to be assessed at full-text for eligibility. Of these, 94 reports were excluded (i.e., 36used non-CCT; 17 had no control arm; 13 were non-randomised;
7 with no parallel arms; 7 had no ADHD diagnosis meeting our
criteria; 3 were registered protocols; 2 re-analysed data alreadyincluded in our meta-analysis; 2 i ncluded participants with non-
eligible neurodevelopmental di sorders; 2 did not share data; 2
did not report relevant data; 1 did not report participant
eligibility criteria; 1 was a conference poster; and 1 did notanswer our data request). This left 42 eligible reports derived
from 36 RCTs (PRISMA Flowchart, see Supplementary Fig. 1;
included reports, see Supplementary Table 3; excluded reportswith reasons, see Supplementary Table 4) giving a total sampleof 2234 participants, double the number of RCTs and triple the
sample size reported in Cortese et al. (2015) (RCTs =16;
sample =759). Of those 36 RCTs, the most common comparator
was a semi-active control ( n=22), followed by WLC ( n=11) and
TAU ( n=3). Most trials recruited children (5 –12-years-old;
n=26), followed by adults (>18-years; n=8), and adolescents
(13-18-years-old; n=2) (see Supplementary Table 2). Most trials
evaluated working memory training (WMT) ( n=17), followed by
multi-process training (MPT) ( n=13), attention training ( n=5),
and inhibitory control training ( n=1). Most trials administered
CCT at home ( n=21), followed by at school ( n=5), in a
laboratory setting ( n=3), the clinic/hospital ( n=2), and a mixed
setting (i.e., home, lab, library, clinic, school; n=5). Several
outcomes were excluded from ﬁve out of the 36 eligible RCTs.
We excluded i) independent evaluator-rated ASRS from Virtaet al (2010) [ 46] because the author had no access to data; ii)
ADHD-RS from Bikic et al. (2017) [ 47] because total scores were

via Akili Interactive Labs, Inc (Boston, MA, USA), who declined toshare data following personal communication. Of the 36 RCTsassessed, overall RoB was judged “high-risk ”in 25 and as being
of“some concerns ”in 10 RCTs (see Supplementary Fig. 2). These
judgments were driven mainly by failures to conceal groupassignment to the outcome assessor (Domain 4, 17 out of 36RCTs) or because they had high levels of missing outcome data
(Domain 3, 14 out of 36 reported >20% drop-outs). Regarding
bias in selection of the reported results (Domain 5), 32 RCTswere judged to be of ‘some concern ’as these did not pre-
register a trial protocol and/or statistical analysis plan. Bias
arising from poor randomisation processes (Domain 1) or due to
deviations of allocation to the intended intervention (Domain 2)were rated infrequent across most RCTs.
Post-treatment outcomes
ADHD symptoms . Of the 36 included trials, 14 reported PBLIND
ADHD outcomes (24 reported MPROX outcomes; for MPROX/
PBLIND outcomes, see Supplementary Table 5; for MPROX results,
see Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 3 and 4).There were small and marginally signi ﬁcant improvements
favouring CCT relative to control in inattention (SMD =0.17,
95%CI[0.02 to 0.33), but no signi ﬁcant effects were seen for ADHD
total (SMD =0.12, 95%CI[ −0.01to 0.25]) or hyperactivity/impulsiv-
ity (SMD =0.11, 95%CI[ −0.04 to 0.27]) symptoms. The improve-
ment in inattention symptoms remained signi ﬁcant when
analyses were restricted to trials with semi-active controls
(SMD=0.20, 95%CI[0.04 to 0.37]), and doubled in size when
restricted to PBLIND outcomes measured in the intervention
setting (SMD =0.40, 95%CI[0.09 to 0.71]). MPT was equivalent to
WMT (MPT, SMD range =0.11 to 0.12, 95%CI range [ −0.15 to 0.38]);
WMT, SMD range =0.08 to 0.17, 95%CI range [ −0.05 to 0.39]).
Heterogeneity was low and non-signi ﬁcant in all analyses (see
Figs. 1and 2, Table 1).
Neuropsychological outcomes
Ratings: Executive functioning based on the Global Executive
Composite of the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive
Function (BRIEF) were rated by PBLIND assessors in only four
trials and MPROX assessors in thirteen trials (see Supplementary
Table 4). MPROX outcomes showed no bene ﬁt for CCT. Hetero-
geneity was non-signi ﬁcant (see Supplementary Table 6 and
Supplementary Fig. 5).

"Laboratory measures: Thirty-two trials included at least one
laboratory measure of neuropsychological outcomes (see Supple-
mentary Table 8). We summarise results from all analyses below.
WM outcomes: Outcomes were based on forward and backward
versions of verbal and visuospatial span tasks. Preliminary analyses
showed that our ﬁndings did not change whether analysing
scores from each version separately or in aggregate, so forsimplicity we report only the aggregated scores below. Results forboth verbal and visuospatial WM tasks favoured CCT with highly
signi ﬁcant but mainly moderate effects across the board. Effects
were generally larger for visuospatial than verbal WM. Hetero-geneity was low-to-moderate but non-signi ﬁcant (see Table 2and
Fig.3).
Other neuropsychological outcomes: There were no bene ﬁts of
CCT for measures of attention, interference control, non-verbal
reasoning, processing speed, or set-shifting either in analysis with
all trials or in the sensitivity analyses. Heterogeneity wassigni ﬁcant for attention and interference control. For motor
inhibition there was signi ﬁcant bene ﬁt of CCT but only in the
subsample of trials with a semi-active control and with <30%
medicated participants. Heterogeneity was non-signi ﬁcant (see
Table 2and Supplementary Fig. 5).Academic outcomes . There were no signi ﬁcant effects of CCT on
any academic outcome (trials: arithmetic ability, n=9; reading
comprehension, n=8; reading ﬂuency, n=7). Heterogeneity was
zero and non-signi ﬁcant (see Table 2, Supplementary Table 8, and
Supplementary Fig. 6).
Meta-regression . Effect size estimates were not signi ﬁcantly
predicted by mean age, publication year, or overall RoB for anyoutcome except for neuropsychological measures of attentionwhere SMDs got smaller over time (see Supplementary Table 10).
Adult ﬁndings . Only eight trials enrolled adult samples. We only
had suf ﬁcient trials to analyse MPROX self-ratings of ADHD total
symptoms (trials, n=5) or laboratory measures of verbal WM
(trials, n=5), with only the latter showing a bene ﬁt in favour of
CCT (SMD =0.49, 95%CI[0.13 –0.84]) (see Table 2).
Follow-up outcomes
Eight trials reported follow-up outcomes (mean, 6-months; range,3–6-months), all of which recruited children aged 9 –12-years. Due
to an insuf ﬁcient number of trials, it was not possible to analyse
PBLIND outcomes in any one domain or laboratory measures
beyond motor inhibition, attention, verbal WM, and readingcomprehension. A signi ﬁcant and small bene ﬁt favouring CCT

"Publication bias
There was no evidence of publication bias in any analysis (seeSupplementary Fig. 7).
Additional exploratory analyses
PBLIND measured most proximally to intervention setting . This
involved replacing most distal PBLIND outcomes, with mostproximal PBLIND outcomes in eight trials. Notably, this did not
materially change the interpretation of the ﬁndings of any of our
previous analyses (for results, see Supplementary Table 11).
Including data from Ko ﬂer et al. (2020) . When Ko ﬂer et. al. 2020
PBLIND parent ratings were added, the ADHD total symptomsbecame marginally signi ﬁcant (SMD =0.13, 95%CI [0.01 to 0.25])
while the signi ﬁcant effects for inattention symptoms increased
slightly, remaining signi ﬁcant (SMD =0.18, 95%CI[0.03 to 0.34]).
The intervention effect for hyperactivity/impulsivity remainednon-signi ﬁcant (SMD =0.12, 95%CI[ −0.03 to −0.27]). In these
exploratory analyses effects sizes remained small.
DISCUSSION
This comprehensive and well-powered meta-analysis found no
evidence to support the use of CCT in its current forms as a stand-
alone treatment for core ADHD symptoms. In our pre-registered
analyses, effects on PBLIND measures of core ADHD features were
limited to a signi ﬁcant, but small, short-term effect on inattention
symptoms, which was substantially unchanged with variations inexperimental control arm. This ﬁnding has possible clinical
relevance given that inattention may become a more importantissue in adulthood [ 6]. However, the small size of the effect
suggested limited clinical signi ﬁcance when compared to the size
of short-term effects of methylphenidate on ADHD core symp-
toms reported in a recent meta-analysis (SMD range =−0·49 to
−0.82, 95%CI range [ −1.16 to −0·62]) [ 5]. In general, the effects
reported in this meta-analysis were smaller than in our previous
meta-analyses –with, for instance, the SMD for PBLIND inattention
symptoms dropping from 0.32 in 2015 to 0.17 in this analysis[14,15]. Equivalent drops in MPROX ratings reported in our
supplementary analysis section (0.47 to 0.27, respectively) suggest
that even trials with inadequately blinded outcomes now providelittle support for the use of CCT as a treatment for ADHDsymptoms. The drop in effect size could be the result of better
blinding by design in more recent trials, but there are other
possible explanations. For instance, our update excluded non-computerized cognitive training and non-validated measures ofADHD symptoms to improve homogeneity of included studies
and outcomes, which meant two relatively large effects included
in our 2015 paper were not carried forward to our update(SMD=0.82 [ 49] and SMD =0.98 [ 48]). Positive effects seen on
visuospatial and verbal WM performance did not transfer to other
neuropsychological processes and/or academic outcomes and insome cases were no longer statistically signi ﬁcant when analyses
were limited to trials with semi-active control arms.
The scale of the current meta-analysis - made possible by the
large number of new trials published in recent years - provided

"scope to explore a range of aspects of the effects of CCT for ADHD
not possible before. First, against expectation, we found no
evidence that MPT was superior to WMT when PBLIND outcomes
were employed. Cortese et al. [ 15] had found a moderate-to-large
effect of MPT on MPROX outcomes. This led us to hypothesizethat, consistent with the notion that ADHD is a neuropsycholo-
gically heterogeneous condition, interventions that target a range
of different cognitive processes would be more effective at theoverall group level because some sub-groups of people withADHD would bene ﬁt from one form of training, while others
would bene ﬁt from a different one. Second, our analysis of trials
where PBLIND measures collected in the same setting in whichthe intervention was delivered (e.g., both at school) producedeffects sizes that were twice the size than those seen for the
analysis of all trials and four times the size of the analysis when
PBLIND assessments were collected in a different setting to theintervention (e.g., at home versus at school). The latter was by far
the most common arrangement but confounded “blindedness ”of
ratings with setting. By disentangling this confound in the currentmeta-analysis, we provide evidence that CCT may producesigni ﬁcant effects of moderate size with minimal heterogeneity,
but this improvement is likely to be setting-speci ﬁc with little
generalisation beyond the training setting to other settings. Giventhe small sample of RCTs ( N=5) in this sensitivity analysis we
encourage future trials to explore this issue systematically by
varying blinded clinical outcomes measured in the same or
different setting to the intervention.
Third, with respect to evidence of the longer-term bene ﬁts of
CCT, positive effects on WM waned and became non-signi ﬁcant
for some outcomes. However, in contrast, there were a number ofoutcomes where signi ﬁcant, though still small, effects emerged
only at follow-up –e.g., objective measures of motor inhibition
and reading comprehension and MPROX ratings of executive
functioning. These later effects, if con ﬁrmed, might represent
“sleeper effects ”–i.e., effects of CCT become consolidated over
time. Such an interpretation remains speculative at this point
given the limited number of high risk-of-bias trials on which the
ﬁndings are based. One other explanation could be that the short-
term effects found in WM were in fact later transferred to apositive effect on associated functions (e.g., academic skills) later
down the line. These tentative explanations could be a focus in
future research along with investigating whether “top-up ”
interventions are required to prolong the short-term bene ﬁtw e
found.
Fourth, as previously reported in our 2015 paper [ 15], WMT
(implemented in 17 out of 36 trials) had limited bene ﬁts, despite
being the most widely available commercial form of CCT. It did not
signi ﬁcantly reduce PBLIND measures of ADHD symptoms, while
its effects on WM were no greater than for other training typesand there was no evidence of generalisation to other outcomes.WMT in people with ADHD appears to produce practice-like gains
with little transfer away from the trained cognitive domain.
Fifth, there were too few relevant trials to draw any strong
conclusions about the value of CCT for adults with ADHD. One
speculation is that the modest, short-term improvements found
for inattention symptoms, but not combined ADHD, in childrenand adolescents might indicate possible bene ﬁts to adults for
whom inattention becomes especially relevant. However, this
would need to be tested speci ﬁcally in future trials.
Sixth, the three exploratory analyses requested during the
review process –i.e., restricting analysis to non-commercially
funded trials, analysing the PBLIND data collected most proximally
rather than most distally, and adding PBLIND parent-rated
outcomes from Ko ﬂer et al. (2020) –
did not change our
interpretation of the results, highlighting the robustness of our
analyses.
We believe that the translational logic of targeting neuropsy-
chological processes thought to mediate ADHD pathophysiologyto improve symptoms and/or neuropsychological processes with
related improvement in functioning still has viability. However,
given the lack of results detailed above, maybe new and
innovative training approaches will be required to move the ﬁeld
forward. These may involve targeting different processes, usingmore focused strategies or different intervention modalities. With
regard to the focused strategies, greater bene ﬁts may be derived
by targeting more basic non-executive functions, like neurophy-siological processes that regulate arousal/motivation or emotions[8], which are thought to function atypically in ADHD and are
potentially related to symptom expression and cognitive impair-
ment [ 50]. Support for this approach might come in the form of
ourﬁnding that performance on forward and backward versions
of verbal or visual span tasks were comparably improved with
CCT, which –given that these types of memory are underpinned
by processes differing in executive demand –would suggest that
the impact of CCT may be on more basic non-executive
functioning. With regard to different intervention modalities,
two options should be explored. First, given that at the individuallevel there is considerable neuropsychological heterogeneity thatmight dilute the group level impact of CCT, the ﬁrst option would
be to more precisely match the training to the needs of the
patients (e.g., WMT could be given to those with WM dif ﬁculties at
baseline). However, the evidence from studies investigatingmoderating/mediating factors for this is limited and con ﬂicting
[51–53], and we were unable to explore the impact of baseline
cognitive performance on the CCT treatment effect as only onestudy screened based on impairment in the trained cognitive
domain at baseline [ 46]. Second, because there is greater plasticity
earlier in development, the second option could be to focustraining on younger age groups than those currently studied(typically between 8 and 14-years or older). For instance,
preliminary work has shown gains in neuropsychological and
some degree of reduction in ADHD symptoms using play-basedinterventions for pre-schoolers that train neurocognitive andbehavioural domains in real-world settings [ 54,55]. Although we
aimed to measure the effect of CCT in pre-schoolers with ADHD,
there were no RCTs with samples of children with a con ﬁrmed
ADHD diagnosis. We may also want to focus more on ecologicallyvalid ways of training neuropsychological functioning, and focus
on parents/caregivers and teachers as builders of functioning
capacities [ 56]. Finally, approaches that more directly target brain
processes are often assumed to be more effective. However,
recent meta-analysis do not support the value of either
neurofeedback [ 33] or non-invasive brain stimulation techniques
(e.g., repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranialdirect current stimulation) [ 57] as ADHD interventions. It may be
that our translation model is wrong and improvements in
neuropsychological functions and symptoms in fact occurindependently, and that CCT effects are going to be limited tothe cognitive domain and/or related functional or educational
outcomes [ 2,58].
There are several limitations to our meta-analysis resulting from
the studies available for inclusion. First, the majority of RCTs suffered
from biases that were judged to be of some or high risk. For
example, high levels of attrition were common - 17 out of 42 reportshad dropouts >20% at post-assessment but did not account for thisanalytically –which may have in ﬂated SMDs. Further, while 14 RCTs
reported PBLIND ADHD outcomes, the remaining 22 used WLC/TAU
controls and/or MPROX outcomes only, meaning that blinding wasunlikely or practically impossible. This raised the risk that outcomeassessors were biased by knowledge of group assignment. Future
RCTs should improve participant retention or provide evidence that
results were not biased by missing data (e.g., running sensitivityanalyses to test whether results changed under plausible assump-
tions about the relationship between missingness in the outcome
and its true value) [ 22]. They should also adopt double-blinded
designs and active controls identical to the active intervention butS.J. Westwood et al.
1411

"without an adaptive component of the targeted function, while also
avoiding making tasks boring and demotivating. This is important as
this component is central to the translational logic of CCT [ 8,13].
Second, very few studies focused on non-childhood samples,meaning that we could not test whether our ﬁndings generalized
to pre-school, adolescent, or adult samples. Third, our meta-analyses
aggregated data from the group level, which can obscure variability
of effects at the level of the individual. We cannot rule out thatmeta-analyses of individual patient data might provide greaterinsights into possible moderators of CCT effects to develop more
personalized CCT programs. Forth, unfortunately, due to an
insufﬁcient number of trials (i.e., less than 5) using MPT, we could
not explore whether MPT is superior to WMT in analyses of severalof the neuropsychological outcomes (e.g., interference inhibition,
processing speed, set-shifting) as well as all academic outcomes, so
it remains for future researchers to explore these matters. Sixth, thelimited evidence of CCT ef ﬁcacy we found raises important
questions about iatrogenic effects, cost-bene ﬁts, and opportunity
costs of CCT, none of which were considered in the included studies.Future studies should address these matters. Seventh, given thetranslational logic of CCT, one would expect CCT effects to
generalise to functional impairments, but only a minority of studies
measured outcomes beyond ADHD symptoms and/or neuropsy-chological outcomes, leaving open the possibility that future studiesmay show that CCT can yield improvements in everyday functioning
or quality of life. Fifth, only seven trials tested effects over the
longer-term. Eighth, one possible limitation is that for one trialidenti ﬁed as meeting inclusion criteria [ 37], we were unable to
calculate effect size estimates for ADHD-RS and TOVA outcomes
because the sponsor (Akili Interactive Labs, Inc) declined to sharedata for complete cases at each assessment time-point. This trial isnoteworthy given its high quality –e.g., unlike any other included
study, it had a very large sample ( N=348) with a pre-registered trial
protocol and analysis plan –so inclusion of these outcomes may
have changed our conclusions. The authors found that compared toan semi-active control, CCT targeting attention and cognitive control
(i.e., AKL-T01) led to no improvement in blinded-parent ADHD-RS
ratings of ADHD symptoms and BRIEF ratings of executivefunctioning, but signi ﬁcantly improved TOVA performance –a
task-based measure of attention. These results point to potential
practice-like gains with transfer limited to the trained cognitive
domain, supporting the main conclusions from our meta-analyses.Further, given the size of this study, if ADHD-RS outcomes were
included in our primary analysis of PBLIND outcomes, it would likely
substantially diminish or even abolish the signi ﬁcant CCT-related
improvement in inattention symptoms we found, further supportingour conclusion of the limited clinical bene ﬁto fC C Ta sas t a n d a l o n e
treatment for ADHD. We agree with the authors, however, that
further investigation into the real-world bene ﬁto fA K L - T 0 1i s
worthwhile. Finally, our protocol precluded trials with head-to-headcomparisons of different interventions. Future analyses should focus
on these.
CONCLUSION
There was no empirical support for the use of CCT as a stand-aloneintervention for ADHD symptoms based on the largest and mostcomprehensive meta-analysis of RCTs conducted to date. Small
effects, of likely limited clinical importance, on inattention
symptoms were found –but these were limited to the setting in
which the intervention was delivered. Robust evidence of small-to-moderate improvements in visual-spatial and verbal STM/WM
tasks did not transfer to other domains of executive functions or
academic outcomes, but these might take time to becomeapparent. New interventions targeting different processes using
different, more ecologically valid, approaches within more focused
intervention strategies are required going forward.REFERENCES

A
bstract 
As part of our continuing effort s to improve inclusion in teaching and learning, we 
examine d cognitive needs in online learning, specifically relating  to attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through a narrative literature review and environmental 
scan, we analyzed current knowledge  reported  in ADHD research to understand its  impact 
on learning for students diagnosed with ADHD and exa mined the interventions and  
strategies that  support their executive function and focus needs, specifically  in an online 
learning context. We used  the lens of a Technology –Content –Pedagogy (TCP) framework  to 
organize and interpret the strategies  for supporting students with ADHD  in online learning .

Introduction  
Article 24 of the United Nation’s Convent ion on the  Rights of  Persons  with D isabilities 
(UNCRPD) recognizes educ ation as a fundamental right of persons with disabilities. Following 
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning has received increasing focus. For learning 
to be inclusive, we need to find new ways to accommodate students with disabilities online (Gin 
et al. 12). Of the different types of  disabilities, c ognitive  disabilities a r e th e least understood  
outside of medical or specialized environments (Blotnicky- Gallant et al. 16 ). 
Attention  deficit hyperactivity di sorder ( A DHD) i s one of the mos t common  cognitive  
disabilities, e stimated to affect 8–10% of childre n and 5–6% of adults worldwide (Ng et al ., 
123). Before reaching 18  ye ars, three girls are diagnose d with ADHD for e ve ry six boys 
di
agnosed ( Dalsgaard et al .). By the age of 25, an estimated 15% of pe ople diagnosed with 
ADHD as children still have a full range of symptoms, and 65% still have some symptoms that 
affect their da il y live s. ADHD remains undiagnosed in many individuals . ADHD is m arked b y 
an ongoing pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity- impulsivity tha t interferes w ith func tioning  
or development, which could impact learning (National  In stitute of Mental Health). 
The accessibility
 team from D2L Corporation, a global learning platform company based 
in Ontario, Canada , collaborated with the Uni versity of Toronto on a 4-month research project to 
explore cognitive needs in online learning. Due to the shor t duration, we focused on ADHD as it 
is highly prevalent and impacts students' ability to focus during class, engage in learning, 
complete tasks, and keep up with assessments. We explored the nature and impact of ADHD and 
the interventions used to mana ge it. B ased on t hat, w e i dentified a set of  teaching  and learning 
strategies for educators focused on technology, content, and pedagogy to support students with 
ADHD in online learning.

Our research objectives were (a) to examine the prevalence and characteristics of ADHD 
and the resulting challenges in the context of learning, an d (b)  identify  mechanisms for educators 
to support online students with ADHD.  Our study wa s driven by two research questions: 
1. What is  the impact of ADHD on the experience of learning?  
2. What are the strategies and tools that help manage online learning with ADHD? 
Methods  
We conducted a narrative literature review (Rumrill Jr and Fitzgerald  166) using the 
following databases: PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, CNAHL, Cochrane Collaboration for 
systematic reviews, ERIC, and Web of Science. We used combinations of the following search 
terms: ADHD, ADD, Attention -Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, online learning, distance 
learning, blended learning, intervention, LMS, learning management system, executive function, behavioural, technology, assistive technology, strategy, accessibility. We  initially identified 
abstracts of 48  original research papers and meta-analyses published in English between Jan 1, 
1990, and June 30, 2021, then selected 30 for in- depth review.  Of these, we identified 12 papers 
(including 4 meta- analys es) as key to our analysis as they contained information that matched 
key topics connecting ADHD to learning. In addition, we conducted an environmental scan (Choo 29) using Google search with  the same terms as for the literature review. We accessed 35 
website s and found 17 pages with relevant information that were included in the analysis. We 
summarized key findings from each study and then identified patterns using qualitative content analysis techniques by tagging and organizing those findings  (Berg  304). We used an online 
learning  framework described in the next section to interpret the findings. ",paper30.pdf,3

This framework comprises  three layers with in the online learning space. First, the

learning and assessment content. Third, the pedagogy  layer, relating to  facilitating inclusive 
pedagogical practices that support Universal Design for Learning (UDL)  principles.  UDL is a 
framewor k to improve and optimize teaching and learning for everyone (CAST). The three 
layers form the online learning stack and are meant to be used together; each layer is necessary

each layer is necessary to ensure ‘full -stack accessibility’ in online learning.  We used this TCP 
framework to organize and interpret our findings .

indings  
About ADHD 
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that typically manifest s early in development 
(Khan et al.  2). Parts of the ADHD brain develop more slowly than a neurotypical brain , 
resulting  in a spectrum of ADHD conditions from mild to severe (Novotney). The Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders  (DSM)  classifies  ADHD into three types , marked by 
(1) inattention, (2) h yperactiv ity/impulsivity , and (3) a combination of both. Combined type is 
the most common form of ADHD, while hyperactive/impulsive is the least common . 
I
n most cases, ADHD is comorbid with other learning or psychiatric conditions, making it 
difficult to differentiate ADHD (Rommelse et al.  282). Many students with significant cognitive 
disabilities might also have co -occurring motor and sensory impairments that impact their ability 
to learn (Erickson and Geist 87).  A diagnosis of ADHD is highly correlated  with lower levels of 
academic success, including lower rates of high school and college completion, and  those with 
ADHD symptoms tend to experience behavioural difficulties and obstacles in their work and  
personal lives (Hoben & Hesson 40). ADHD is marked by a delay in the normal developmental 
unfolding of cortical executive function. 
Executive function is the ability to perform goal-directed tasks using organizational skills 
and the ability to plan, sustain attention , and control impulsivity (Rigoni et al . 875).  All persons 
with ADHD, regardless of subtype or severity , are characteri zed by an  impairment of executive 
function (Brown 38). Students with ADHD perform more poorly on measures of executive ",paper30.pdf,5

among other things. However, they can excel in academic settings  if supported with appropriate 
interventions ( Brown  39; Levy and Hay  43). 
I
nterventions  Used with ADHD 
T
here are two primary forms of interventions used to manage ADHD : medical , and 
behavioural. Traditionally, stimulant medication h as been  the main intervention for ADHD, and 
it still plays a major part in managing the condition with or without other forms of intervention. 
Over two -thirds of children and teens who have been diagnosed with ADHD take medication to 
manage  it (CDC) . But medication is  found to be minimally effective in increasing academic 
achievement or improving peer relationships (Chronis, Jones, & Raggi 6), which tend to res pond 
better to b ehavioural interventions (Clay 45) .  
Behavioural intervention from parents and teachers is  another form of support for 
ADHD.  While most of such interventions require physical co-presence, it is possible to use them 
in an online context with  synchronous meeting tools and pedagogical processes (Andersen  and 
Sorensen). A combination of medical and  behavioural interventions is found to be optimally  
effective (Barbaresi  et al . S36; Wolraich et al . 1740).  
St
rategies for Teaching and Learning 
Several strategies have been reported for support ing learning with ADHD, some of them 
for use by teachers  as behavioural interventions and some of them by students as measures for 
self-monitoring or self -regulation . We examined  the strategies  through the TCP framework lens. 
Table 1 lists  the strategies under technology, content, or pedagogy based on which  layer each of 
the strategies  is predominant ly associat ed. These are each discussed further below.

Technologies used most in special education are c omputer- based and web -based (Liu, 
Wu, and Chen 3620). The options to support students with ADHD through technology are ever-
increasing. However, find ing the right tool to address a student’s specific needs could get 
challenging given the variance in the characteristics of ADHD across different students (Mosher 
et al., 2020, p. 2). These characteristics may affect the way each of them  responds to specific 
technologies. ",paper30.pdf,7
" Learning with ADHD: A Review of Technologies and Strategies  256 
Journal on Technology and Persons with Disabilities  
Santiago, J. (Eds): CSUN Assistive Technology Conference  
© 2022 California State University, Northridge  Digital technologies offer possibilities for multimodal expression/communication 
amongst students and teachers. Some technologies focus on aiding  students with ADHD for 
production and dissemination of information such as  accessible authoring tools with dictation 
suppor t or speech -to-text programs, and accessible information consumption with text- to-speech 
and highlighting tools (Sorensen and Andersen 49 ). Assistive tools for reading difficulty use 
various combinations of instructional strategies to grab learners’ attention and focus (Thapliyal 
& Ahuja, 2021, p. 2). Mobile devices such as  iPad and  iPhone allow  students to store learning 
material including textbooks in apps like the iBooks. This technology allows the  use of strategies 
like highlighting and note- taking for boosting reading comprehension, which are critical for 
students with low attention.   
Some technological tools help students with  self-monitoring their progress with learning 
or task completion (Blotnicky- Gallant et al. 5 ). Re minder systems and intelligent agents help 
with remember ing recurring tasks such as complet ing assignments for self-regulation (Rigoni et 
al., 2020, p. 882). T eachers use these strategies in their classrooms, to provide their students with 
ADHD with optimal interventions  to enhance both their learning and behavioural functioning at 
school (Blotnicky -Gallant et al. 16) . Virtual reality environments can help foster rapid interaction 
and real -time feedback, keep students active by performing activities on their own or in 
collaboration with other students, and allow teachers to have tools to measure student performance and provide feedback (Cardona- Reyes et  al. 3787).  
Well -designed technology strategies have the potential to  provide visibility to  what 
students can  do and what they know. When things go well, the self -esteem of the student 
improves; when they do not, there is an opportunity for teacher insight into what to  improve to 
provide adequate support (Sorensen and Andersen 57).  ",paper30.pdf,8

(Sorensen 50). Teachers must focus on maintaining consistency in their communication and 
learning material . An effective strateg y for this is to provide templates with appropriate structure 
to the students for creating content, artifacts and submissions for assessment, note- taking for 
comprehension, or communicating (Cinquin 165).  
It could get difficult for students with ADHD to simultaneously work on content and 
structure.  Templates serve to scaffold their learning process. Writing templates can offer the 
student a frame for the task at hand. These could be created by teachers using popular software 
such as MS PowerPoint or MS Word.  
From a pedagogy perspective, several  strategies are reported  to promote consumption and 
production of information by the learner  as well as engagement with the learning process. To 
make consumption of learning material easier, teachers  are encouraged to use multi-modal 
representation and comm unication (Sorensen 53). This helps with providing choices to the 
students to engage through the mode that best suits them. Providing students flexibility for task completion such as  allowing multiple modes for task completion ( oral as well as  written ) 
facilitate s submissions. C ommunication  can be facilitated  through building in means for 
collaboration and knowledge-building (Sorensen & Andersen 46). 
Engagement with the learning material is enhanced through information chunking, which 
refers to dividing content or assignments into smaller parts or modif ying them to reduce the 
length of tasks  to enable students to complete each piece without losing their attention.  Research 
indicates that f requent feedback , positive attention,  and rewards motivate students with ADHD to  
remain engaged and respond better (Rigoni et al., 2020, p. 882). Awards and game- based ",paper30.pdf,9

students from distraction (Sorensen 53). 
Peer tutoring is another useful pedagogical strateg y that draws upon other students. Peer 
tutors are sometimes enrolled into the same course as  the student. They help students interpret 
the course material and assist them in understanding what is expected of them  in that course. 
How the  peer tutor work s with the student to help them be successful in the course depends on 
the level of accommodation that student needs (Blotnicky -Gallant et al. 15).  
Some strategies could require additional preparation time, such as  providing advanced 
organizers for content and  customizing  learning materials for the studen t. When teachers use 
these strategies in their classrooms, their students with ADHD are provided with optimal 
interventions that may enhance both their learning and behavioural functioning at school (Blotnicky -Gallant et al. 16).  It is important, therefore, to ensure that teachers have appropriate 
training and support for the time required  to implement such evidence- based strategies . 
Discussion  
Technology emerged as  a strong factor in providing behavioural interventions to students 
with ADHD in online learning both directly as a modality- interchange tool and indirectly as a 
vehicle for supporting content creation and consumption using templates. The pedagogical processes that support students with ADHD align with UDL principles (REF) , enabling multiple 
modes of content and communication, and multiple means of action, expression, and engagement . This suggests that the practice of inclusive education based on UDL princi ples 
would greatly benefit students with ADHD in the class, both for students who declared their disability and for those who did not. ",paper30.pdf,10

© 2022 California State University, Northridge  Regarding the usefulness of the TCP framework for categorizing  the strategies, it is 
evident from Table 1 that some strategies based on mindfulness (Xue et al. 1), humour (Erdoğdu 
& Çakıroğlu 3), and exercise (Ng et al. 124) that have a positive effect on learning do not fit into it directly. Humour could be applied to some extent to pedagogy, especially to teacher -to-student 
and student- to-student communication . Erdoğdu and Çakıroğlu (3) posit three dimensions of 
student engagement: behavioural, emotional, and cognitive. When humour is infused into a learning activity, it creates a positive emotional atmosphere. This can increase motivation and engagement. Thus, using humour brings students and teachers closer (Mayer & Estrella, 14).  
The three layers , technology, content, and pedagogy , also intersect with one another (see 
Fig 1).  This affords us to consider if any of the  strategies might  lie in the cusp of two layers , or at 
the intersection of all three layers . Considering the case of  a text reader that highlights and reads 
out text loud. While this is a technology, it also improves engagement. It is  arguable whether the 
strategy that engages  the student using a text reader to consume learning content  would fall 
under technology, or at the intersection of  technology and pedagogy or at the intersection of all 
three layers in the centre. We would argue that it falls only under technology as the increased 
engagement is not on account of anything the teacher did or designed into the content but because of the technology. More work needs to be done to examine strategies from this angle. 
Further, much more work is needed to examine the effectiveness of strategies and 
combinations of strategies. Many of the strategies considered in the reviewed literature were suggested based on findings (e.g., Rigoni et al. 881) or reported based on teacher use (Blotnicky -
Gallant et al. 9). Other strategies or approaches were explored in research, but effectiveness of the strategies was not measured (e.g., Sorensen & Andersen, 47-48). Given the range of experience for learners with ADHD, it is important eviden ce for strategy effectiveness includes ",paper30.pdf,11

between group and within-subject designs is important to provide evidence for strategy effectiveness in the population of learners with ADHD (Fabiano et al. 130). 
Co
nclusions  
T
hrough this research, we derived insights about the accessibility needs of students with 
ADHD and ways to support them in an online learning environment. W e drew our data for this 
research  only from secondary research and did not gather empirical data. Conducting primary 
research with students with a range of cognitive needs is an important future goal . It would also 
be useful to examine other cognitive conditions such as learning disabilit ies, autism spectrum, 
and developmental disabilities. Supporting students with cognitive disabilities who require specialized attention from teachers and specialists during the se pandemic time s is vital to ensure 
they are not left behind.

Abstract
Cognitive neuroscience studies of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) suggest 
multiple loci of pathology with respect to both cognitive domains and neural circuitry. Cognitive 
deficits extend beyond executive functioning to include spatial, temporal, and lower-level “non-
executive” functions. Atypical functional anatomy extends beyond frontostriatal circuits to include 
posterior cortices, limbic regions, and the cerebellum. Pathophysiology includes dopaminergic as 
well as noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems. We review the major insights gained from 
functional brain imaging studies in ADHD and discuss working hypotheses regarding their 
neurochemical underpinnings.

Application of functional brain imaging methods has brought unprecedented insights into 
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), confirming its origins as a condition of 
altered neurobiological development that particularly impacts higher-order cognition. 
Symptoms of inattention, distractibility, and impulsivity that define ADHD suggest selective 
weakness of regulatory or control processes that are subsumed under the label “executive” in 
psychological theory. Indeed, the locus of most cognitive neuroscience research on ADHD 
has been component processes of executive control such as response inhibition [reviewed in 
Bush et al., 2005 ]. However, increasingly studies are pointing to atypicalities in other 
cognitive domains and in lower-level “nonexecutive” functions and their underlying brain 
circuitry. As a result, the developing consensus among researchers supports a model of 
neuropathological heterogeneity produced by alterations in multiple neurocognitive circuits.
This brief review presents the current status of human research on ADHD that elucidates its 
neuropathophysiology and yields hypotheses for future investigations. First, we present a 
synthesis of the main insights gained from studies using functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) that visualizes oxygen-dependent hemodynamic change induced by

to the extent that they explicate the fMRI findings. Findings are organized by 
neuroanatomical circuits—frontostriatal, mesolimbic, motor, and parietal–temporal, 
distinguished by the functional domain they most critically enable. Second, we discuss 
pathophysiology that unifies the seemingly diverse deficits and outline working hypotheses 
and methodological approaches for future investigation.
FUNCTIONAL NEUROPATHOLOGY
Frontostriatal Circuitry
This circuit comprises lateral prefrontal, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsal striatal regions 
such as caudate and is linked to the cerebellum via the thalamus. It mediates task-relevant 
response selection without affective value, often labeled “cool” executive function and has 
been evoked with tasks requiring suppression of prepotent actions (e.g., Stop signal, Go/No-
go, Stroop), resisting interference from irrelevant stimuli (e.g., Flanker task, Multisource 
interference task), maintenance and manipulation within working memory (e.g., N-back 
task, PASAT, mental rotation), and cued switching between responses (e.g., Meiran Switch 
task). This circuit has been the focus of most fMRI work in children, adolescents, and adults 
with ADHD and has provided three main insights as described in the following three 
paragraphs.
First, the frontostriatal network appears to be underactivated in ADHD in most studies 
[confirmed in meta-analysis by Dickstein et al., 2006 ]. Across studies, reduced activation 
was observed in lateral aspects of frontal cortex ventrally (BA 44, 45/47, inferior frontal 
gyrus) in regions that mediate inhibition and selection of response sets, and dorsally (BA 
9/46, middle frontal gyrus) in regions that maintain and manipulate goal-relevant 
representations in working memory, and medially in the anterior cingulate (BA 24), a region 
associated with monitoring errors and response conflict. Across studies, the caudate has 
been consistently underactivated in subjects with ADHD. Regarding prefrontal cortex, 
different tasks draw upon subregions to different extents (e.g., Stroop-tasks activate anterior 
cingulate, response inhibition activates right inferior frontal regions, and working memory 
relies on dorsolateral prefrontal regions). The same task (e.g., Go/No-go) also activates 
subregions of prefrontal cortex to different extents across studies. Further, prefrontal 
activation varies across individuals by level of performance in some studies; ADHD 
adolescents with worse inhibitory performance activated inferior frontal (BA 47) and 
frontopolar (BA 10) cortex to a greater extent relative to controls [ Schulz et al., 2004 , 
2005a ,b]. Greater rather than reduced prefrontal recruitment in low performers, particularly 
in medial regions that are not part of frontostriatal circuitry (BA 10), may reflect use of 
compensatory strategies. Thus, prefrontal involvement is sensitive to subject and 
performance-related factors that vary across studies. Convergent evidence for atypical 
frontal–striatal involvement points to the frontostriatal circuit as a core site of 
neuropathology in ADHD.
Second, several studies have documented deficits in temporal processing in ADHD that are 
likely to reflect atypical cerebellar function. Children with ADHD perform worse than 
controls on time estimation tasks especially at long durations [reviewed in Castellanos and Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 2
Dev Disabil Res Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,2
"Tannock, 2002 ]. While no study has imaged temporal processing without motor/executive 
demands, children with ADHD showed reduced cerebellar involvement on a task involving 
use of temporal information during response inhibition and selection [ Durston et al., 2007 ]. 
Temporal processing deficits could be primary (e.g., atypical temporal coding) or secondary 
to deficits in executive control (e.g., decision-making demands of estimation task) and 
motivation (e.g., inability/unwillingness to wait longer durations).
Third, behavioral studies show considerable heterogeneity in the magnitude of executive 
deficits in ADHD. A meta-analysis of 83 studies involving 6,700 subjects found small to 
moderate effect sizes for differences between ADHD and control groups on a variety of 
“cool” executive tasks ( d = 0.4–0.7 [ Willcutt et al., 2005 ]). Larger effect sizes were 
observed for spatial working memory tasks ( d = 0.85–1.14 [ Martinussen et al., 2005 ]) 
indicating less heterogeneity in spatial working memory function.
In sum, atypical frontostriatal involvement is well documented in ADHD. Individual 
variability in prefrontal recruitment and magnitude of executive dysfunction suggests that 
phenotypic heterogeneity is an important functional characteristic of ADHD.
Mesolimbic Circuitry
This circuit includes ventromedial prefrontal regions such as orbitofrontal gyri (BA 10, 11) 
and anterior cingulate (BA 32), and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens) as well as medial–
temporal limbic regions of amygdala and hippocampus. It mediates task-relevant response 
selection with affective value, often labeled “hot” executive function and has been evoked 
using tasks manipulating motivational properties with reward contingencies (e.g., reward 
anticipation, delay aversion, gambling). Behavioral and fMRI studies in ADHD have led to 
three main insights as described in the following three paragraphs.
First, many (but not all) behavioral studies indicate atypical sensitivity to reward in children 
with ADHD, although there are differences in experimental design across studies making 
comparisons difficult [reviewed in Luman et al., 2005 ]. In studies showing group 
differences, children with ADHD showed greater sensitivity to reinforcement on behavior 
but reduced sensitivity on physiological measures, greater delay aversion, the preference for 
immediate over delayed rewards, and risky decision-making on gambling tasks. Thus, 
motivational deficits characterize some children with ADHD.
Second, two fMRI studies suggest altered functional connectivity within components of 
mesolimbic circuitry in ADHD. During anticipation to reward, ventral striatal regions were 
less activated in ADHD than control adolescents [ Scheres et al., 2006 ] and adults [ Strohle et 
al., 2008 ]. Following delivery of reward, however, that region was activated in ADHD but 
not in control children. Elevated response to reward delivery in ADHD has also been noted 
using scalp-related electrophysiological potentials [ Holroyd et al., 2008 ]. These findings 
suggest qualitative differences in encoding of reward information in ADHD. Further, 
orbitofrontal cortex was activated in control but not children with ADHD [ Strohle et al., 
2008 ]. This prefrontal region exerts an inhibitory influence over ventral striatum, and its 
lack of involvement in ADHD suggests weak “top–down” control signals. Together, these Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,3
"findings suggest atypical reward-related modulation of the orbitofrontal–ventral striatal 
network in ADHD.
Third, one fMRI study suggests altered functional connectivity between mesolimbic and 
frontostriatal circuitry in ADHD. During a gambling task, activation was reduced in the 
hippocampus but greater in dorsal anterior cingulate in ADHD relative to control adults 
[Ernst et al., 2003 ].
In sum, similar to “cool” executive function, deficits of “hot” executive function are often, 
but not always, found in ADHD, while few fMRI studies suggest an atypical relationship 
within regions of mesolimbic circuitry as well as in their relationship to frontostriatal 
regions. Despite interaction between regions of the two circuits, “hot” and “cool” executive 
dysfunction is dissociated, because it is weakly correlated among children with ADHD 
[Sonuga-Barke et al., 2003 ]. Thus, it is important to elucidate the process-specific 
contribution of component regions to motivational and executive function.
Motor-Execution Circuitry
This section describes findings from studies using tasks requiring simple motor execution 
involving sensorimotor cortex and associated regions. Behaviorally, children with ADHD 
show subtle motor abnormalities such as slower and variable response latencies [ Leth-
Steensen et al., 2000 ] and excessive motor overflow (i.e., unintentional movements on the 
other side of the body [ Denckla and Rudel, 1978 ]). In the brain, activation in contralateral 
primary motor and right superior parietal cortex was reduced in ADHD relative to control 
children, despite similar self-paced finger-to-thumb sequencing performance [ Mostofsky et 
al., 2006 ]. These findings may reflect immature motor circuitry as suggested by reduced 
neural inhibition within the corticospinal tract (measured by transcranial magnetic 
stimulation) in children with ADHD [ Moll et al., 2000 ]. Further, motor abnormalities relate 
to executive function, because motor overflow was positively correlated with response 
inhibition performance [ Mostofsky et al., 2003 ]. These findings are consistent with anatomic 
organization such that motor–premotor circuits parallel those for goal-relevant response 
selection. Thus, lower-level motor abnormalities are observed in children with ADHD and 
may contribute to executive dysfunction.
Parietal–Temporal Circuitry
While traditionally not considered central to cognitive dysfunction in ADHD, posterior 
cortices are gaining attention in investigations of visual–spatial functioning and in their 
contribution to executive control. This work provides three insights as described in the 
following three paragraphs.
First, right parietal involvement was reduced in children with ADHD relative to controls 
during a spatial working memory task. During mental rotation, reductions were observed in 
inferior parietal [ Vance et al., 2007 ] and superior parietal and temporal [ Silk et al., 2005 ] 
gyri. Thus, underactivation of right parietal cortex may contribute to spatial working 
memory impairment in ADHD.Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 4
Dev Disabil Res Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,4
"Second, parietal–temporal involvement during visual and auditory selective attention was 
reduced in ADHD relative to control children and adolescents, despite similar task 
performance. During oddball tasks that examine involuntary attention to novel stimuli, 
reductions were observed in the precuneus and supramarginal and angular gyri bilaterally 
[Tamm et al., 2006 ], superior and middle temporal gyri and posterior cingulate [ Rubia et al., 
2007 ], and parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala [ Stevens et al., 2007 ]. During voluntary 
selective attention, reductions were observed in right superior parietal lobe during a visual 
search task [ Booth et al., 2005 ] and left posterior middle temporal gyrus during an auditory/
verbal task [ Shafritz et al., 2004 ]. Thus, multiple regions in medial and lateral parietal and 
temporal lobes were under-activated in ADHD.
Third, parietal–temporal regions were more activated in children with ADHD relative to 
controls on several executive tasks that showed reduced prefrontal activation [reviewed in 
Fass-bender and Schweitzer, 2006 ]. The specific locus of these increases differed across 
studies and tasks. Activation was greater in medial parietal cortex during Flanker 
interference [ Vaidya et al., 2005 ], in posterior superior temporal [ Vaidya et al., 2005 ] and 
inferior parietal [ Rubia et al., 1999 ; Durston et al., 2003 ] regions during response inhibition, 
and in parietal and occipital cortices during working memory [ Schweitzer et al., 2000 ]. 
Greater posterior activation during executive function may be a product of weak prefrontal 
inhibition of sensorimotor cortices or use of alternate performance strategies (e.g., reliance 
on visual–spatial processes during auditory working memory [ Schweitzer et al., 2000 ]).
Thus, convergent evidence supports atypical parietal–temporal involvement in ADHD. 
Together, evidence from all four circuits indicates that functional neuropathology in ADHD 
extends beyond frontal–striatal regions and executive control to include motor and posterior 
cortices and associated sensory functions. In addition to the distributed nature of 
pathological loci, two themes emerge across studies: (1) individual variability in behavioral 
performance and functional anatomical findings suggests substantial phenotypic 
heterogeneity; (2) the nature of atypical activation (i.e., more or less) in regions within and 
across circuits suggests alteration in functional connectivity.
STRUCTURAL NEUROPATHOLOGY
Findings from structural MRI studies provide some insight into the fMRI findings reviewed 
above. First, subjects with ADHD had reduced volumes or cortical thinning in regions 
encompassing all four circuits, including medial and lateral prefrontal, premotor, striatal, 
right parietal, superior and medial temporal, and cerebellar regions [reviewed in Seidman et 
al., 2005 ]. Thus, alteration in structural maturation may mediate functional atypicalities 
observed in fMRI studies. Second, in addition to differences in selective regions, there are 
global brain differences between ADHD and control children. Lobular volumes and cortical 
folding was reduced, suggesting early onset of maturational alteration in prenatal 
development [Wolosin et al., 2007]. Third, longitudinal studies indicate that maturational 
timecourse was similar between groups but was delayed in ADHD by ~3 years [ Shaw et al., 
2007a ]. Thus, patterns of functional activation in subjects with ADHD may reflect immature 
rather than aberrant functional anatomy. Fourth, adults with ADHD had reduced integrity of 
white matter microstructure in a tract connecting frontal and parietotemporal cortices in the Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 5

"right hemisphere [ Makris et al., 2008 ]. Weak structural connectivity is likely to reduce 
functional connectivity between those regions. Additionally, there were relative gray matter 
differences between those regions: gray matter was reduced in prefrontal cortex but greater 
in posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions in ADHD relative to control children 
[Sowell et al., 2003 ]. Together, the white and gray matter findings suggest that weaker top–
down control by prefrontal cortex and larger parietotemporal cortices may facilitate the 
compensatory involvement of posterior cortices observed during executive control tasks in 
fMRI studies. Fifth, individual variability in structural developmental trajectories predicted 
symptom progression. Children with ADHD with persisting symptoms in adolescence had 
thinner medial prefrontal cortex relative to controls, and those with remitted symptoms in 
adolescence had right parietal cortical thickness similar to controls [ Shaw et al., 2006 ]. 
Therefore, structural brain differences may mediate, at least in part, phenotypic 
heterogeneity characterizing ADHD.
NEUROCHEMICAL PATHOLOGY
The developing consensus among researchers is that the anatomically distributed and 
phenotypically heterogeneous nature of neurocognitive abnormalities in ADHD can be 
reconciled within dysfunction of catecholaminergic neurotransmitters, dopamine (DA) and 
nor-epinephrine (NE). Interaction of the two systems subserves “top–down” control of 
behavior by increasing “signal” and decreasing “noise” to optimize adaptation to the 
environment [reviews in Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005 ; Brennan and Arnsten, 2008 ]. Both 
systems play a modulatory role (e.g., NE in regulating arousal, DA in reward processing) 
and determine the balance between sensory/reactive and control processes.
While the two systems largely overlap in anatomy, differences in distribution of 
transporters/receptors subserve functional anatomical selectivity. Dopaminergic and 
noradrenergic neurons originate in the midbrain with axonal networks innervating 
frontostriatal and mesolimbic circuitry as well as parietal cortices. Distribution of 
transporters differs such that DA transporters are abundant in caudate and low in prefrontal 
cortex, whereas NE transporters are abundant in prefrontal cortex but absent in caudate 
[Madras et al., 2005 ]. Further, D1 receptors are higher in the caudate relative to prefrontal 
cortex whereas D4 receptors and multiple NE receptors operate in prefrontal cortex but not 
in striatum. These anatomical differences in the physiological regulation of DA/NE levels 
influence the pattern of functional neuropathology and effects of medications in ADHD.
Effects of Medication
Catecholaminergic dysfunction as a working hypothesis of ADHD stems from the action of 
stimulant medication such as methylphenidate (MPH). MPH effectively alleviates ADHD 
symptoms temporarily following acute administration of small doses (0.10–2.0 mg/kg), in 
the majority of children with ADHD (60–70%). It enhances synaptic DA in the striatum by 
inhibiting reuptake by DA transporters and DA and NE in prefrontal cortex by stimulating 
receptors. Behaviorally, MPH improves performance on “cool” [reviewed in Pietrzak et al., 
2006 ] and “hot” (e.g., gambling [ Devito et al., 2008 ]) executive function and lower-level 
sensory processing (e.g., auditory [ Korostenskaja et al., 2008 ] and visual [ Jonkman et al., Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 6
Dev Disabil Res Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,6
"1997 ]). Thus, pharmacological modulation of catecholamines has widespread effects 
extending to all circuits affected in ADHD.
Pharmacological fMRI studies suggest that MPH restores functional integrity of regions 
known to be deficient in ADHD. MPH improved response inhibition but by variable effects 
in the striatum: increases in children with ADHD but decreases in controls, relative to 
activation without MPH [ Vaidya et al., 1998 ]. This group difference suggests differences in 
baseline striatal DA transmission, because striatal MPH effects are mediated by DA rather 
than by NE. Further, MPH also increased activation in prefrontal cortex, in lateral [ Vaidya et 
al., 1998 ] and medial [ Bush et al., 2008 ] regions that are hypoactivated during inhibitory 
functions in subjects with ADHD without MPH. Unlike the striatum, prefrontal modulation 
by MPH relates to increased DA and NE [ Berridge et al., 2006 ], by stimulating D1 receptors 
to enhance DA and alpha-2-adrenoreceptors to enhance NE [ Arnsten, 2006 ]. Thus, while 
striatal findings in ADHD reflect DA dysfunction, those in prefrontal cortex reflect DA and 
NE dysfunction.
Nonstimulant medications that selectively enhance NE levels are effective for some ADHD 
symptoms, although less widely than stimulants [ Spencer and Biederman, 2002 ]. 
Atomoxetine inhibits NE transporter and guanfacine stimulates alpha-2-adrenoreceptors, to 
enhance NE. In animals, suboptimal prefrontal NE results in a phenotype similar to ADHD, 
and NE agonists and antagonists enhance and reduce working memory function, 
respectively [reviewed in Brennan and Arnsten, 2008 ]. Further, pharmacological fMRI 
studies in rats showed reduction in striatal structures and increase in frontal cortex, relative 
to activation without atomoxetine [ Easton et al., 2006 , 2007 ]; there are no human fMRI 
studies with these medications. Thus, efficacy of NE agonists for ADHD is likely to be 
mediated by modulating prefrontal–striatal functional relationships.
Pathology in ADHD
Ligand-based brain imaging studies provide direct support for altered DA transmission in 
ADHD in prefrontal cortex, striatum, and limbic structures. Direct evidence for 
noradrenergic dysfunction in ADHD is currently lacking because reliable selective NE 
ligands are still under development. One locus of pathology in ADHD is posited to be 
reduced striatal DA because many (but not all) studies have found higher expression of DA 
transporters in the caudate in subjects with ADHD [reviewed in Spencer et al., 2005 ]. 
Indeed, D2/D3 receptor availability and DA release were reduced in the caudate in adults 
with ADHD [ Volkow et al., 2007 ]. While fMRI cannot image DA activity directly, 
pharmacological fMRI studies show that it is sensitive to metabolic consequences of DA 
release [reviewed in Vaidya, 2002 ]. Thus, reduced striatal activation in subjects with ADHD 
observed in fMRI studies may relate to reduced DA in that region. Further, that study 
showed that DA release was also reduced in the hippocampus and the amygdala. These 
regions have not been targeted by fMRI studies as yet. Direct evidence for prefrontal DA 
dysfunction in ADHD comes from imaging of DOPA decarboxylase activity indexing 
presynaptic processes. DA activity was reduced in medial and left lateral prefrontal cortex in 
adults [ Ernst et al., 1998 ] but was greater in midbrain dopaminergic nuclei in adolescents 
[Ernst et al., 1999 ] with ADHD relative to controls. It is not possible to draw inferences Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 7

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,7
"about fMRI findings based on these studies, because how DOPA decarboxylase activity 
relates to fMRI signals is not known. Nevertheless, those findings point to possible 
developmental differences in region-specific DA activity and, furthermore, show alterations 
in regions comprising both mesolimbic and frontostriatal circuitry. Thus, ligand-based 
imaging provides strong support for altered DA transmission in the caudate, but the nature 
of DA or NE pathology in prefrontal cortex remains to be elucidated.
Current Models of ADHD
Models differ in putative pathological pathways and the level of elaboration of 
pathophysiology. In general, models accounting for human data posit dual pathways, 
whereas those accounting for animal data posit single pathways. As each model is detailed 
elsewhere, they are briefly summed here to highlight current working hypotheses. First, a 
dissociation has been posited between frontostriatal and mesolimbic circuits as independent 
sources of pathology accounting for dissociable “cool” and “hot” executive deficits 
[Sonuga-Barke, 2002 ; Castellanos et al., 2006 ]. Second, a computational model 
distinguishes between dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathophysiology in ADHD [ Frank et 
al., 2007 ]. Both “hot” and “cool” executive deficits are posited to result from dopamine 
deficiency in frontostriatal and mesolimbic pathways, whereas the greater response 
variability results from noradrenergic deficiency (high tonic but low phasic signals). Third, 
one single pathway account emphasizes reduced dopamine in mesolimbic circuits leading to 
altered reinforcement and extinction processes, as a causal route to all symptoms and 
deficits observed in ADHD [ Sagvolden et al., 2005 ]. This account emphasizes learning 
abnormalities in ADHD, an area with few human studies. Fourth, other single pathway 
models focus upon regional physiology in striatal DA signaling, positing reduced tonic and 
increased phasic firing [ Seeman and Madras, 2002 ] or in prefrontal DA and NE, positing 
deficient D1 and alpha-2-adrenoreceptor actions [ Brennan and Arnsten, 2008 ].
In sum, while catecholaminergic pathophysiology is agreed upon by researchers, its specific 
nature remains to be elucidated. Current models differ from each other mainly in the level of 
elaboration and anatomy of emphasis. As such, putative accounts are not mutually exclusive. 
A primary challenge for any model is to account for phenotypic heterogeneity in ADHD. 
We discuss two potential physiological sources of heterogeneity below.
PHENOTYPIC HETEROGENEITY
Properties of Catecholamine Function
Two properties of catecholaminergic function may induce heterogeneity in symptom 
expression, response to medication, cognitive dysfunction, and functional anatomy. First, 
animal studies show an inverted-U relationship between level of prefrontal catecholamines 
and behavior [ Brennan and Arnsten, 2008 ]. Moderate levels of DA and NE are optimal, with 
too much leading to distractibility and too little leading to inattentiveness. Thus, the small 
effect sizes for group differences on executive function observed in behavioral studies 
probably relate to individual variation in subjects’ positions on the inverted-U function. 
Individual variation in catecholamine levels also determines response to MPH. Ligand-based 
imaging studies in ADHD found that MPH-induced increases in striatal DA were associated Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 8
Dev Disabil Res Rev . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 19.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript",paper4.pdf,8
"with symptoms of inattention in adults [ Volkow et al., 2007 ] and attentional task 
performance (e.g., TOVA) in adolescents [ Rosa-Neto et al., 2005 ]; subjects with smaller DA 
changes had more inattention symptoms and poorer task performance. Thus, phenotypic 
expression is likely to be mediated, at least in part, by catecholamine levels.
Second, DA activity is sensitive to environmental context. Efficacy of MPH for ADHD 
varies by situational factors. Reduction in symptoms was greater in a classroom than 
playground setting [ Swanson et al., 2002 ]. Direct evidence for the influence of 
environmental factors on DA function comes from two ligand-based imaging studies. In 
healthy adults, striatal DA response to MPH was greater in the context of motivationally 
salient stimuli (e.g., display of food for hungry subjects [ Volkow et al., 2002 ]) and related 
positively with subjects’ evaluation of task salience (e.g., rated “interest” in mathematical 
task [ Volkow et al., 2004 ]). Thus, how engaging/salient the task is to subjects is likely to 
induce variability in prefrontal–striatal activation and its modulation by MPH in fMRI 
studies. In addition to endogenous factors, therefore, exogenous factors also determine 
catecholaminergic function.
Genetic Polymorphisms
One endogenous source of subject and functional anatomical heterogeneity in 
catecholaminergic function is genetic variation. Allelic variations influence phenotype 
expression and structural and functional anatomy by either enhancing or reducing receptor/
transporter function.
Prevalence of ADHD has been associated with genetic polymorphisms for DA receptors 
(DRD1, DRD4, DRD5) and transporter (DAT1) and NE receptors (DBH, alpha-2-
adrenoreceptor) and transporter (NET) (reviewed in [ Faraone et al., 2005 ]), although many 
studies also failed to find associations. The most consistent evidence comes from DAT1 and 
DRD4, with greater prevalence of ADHD associated with homozygosity of the 10-repeat 
allele of DAT1 [see Yang et al., 2007  for meta-analysis] and the 7-repeat allele of DRD4. 
Homozygosity for these alleles reduces DA function, in the striatum by DAT1 and in 
prefrontal cortex by DRD4. The mixed findings across studies may reflect that multiple 
genotypes in combination, but not alone, confer vulnerability to ADHD.
DA alleles associated with ADHD affect cognitive functions dependent upon frontal–
striatal, motor, and parietal regions in ADHD and control subjects. Homozygous ADHD 10-
repeat DAT1 carriers had greater motor response variability and atypical visual–spatial 
attention [ Bellgrove et al., 2005 ] and those for 7-repeat DRD4 had worse sustained attention 
[Kieling et al., 2006 ] relative to heterozygotes. Homozygous 10-repeat DAT1 controls had 
atypical spatial attention (left-sided inattention [ Bellgrove et al., 2007 ]), poor response 
inhibition and selective attention, and more hyperactive/impulsive behaviors [ Cornish et al., 
2005 ] relative to heterozygotes. Further, homozygous 7-repeat DRD4 controls had poor 
response inhibition [ Congdon et al., 2008 ] and more attentional problems [ Schmidt et al., 
2001 ] relative to heterozygotes. Most importantly, these genotypes have additive effects on 
executive function, because homozygous carriers of both 10-repeat DAT1 and 7-repeat 
DRD4 alleles had the worst response inhibition [ Congdon et al., 2008 ]. Thus, relative Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 9

"differences in allelic inheritance of catecholaminergic genes induce symptomatic and 
cognitive heterogeneity.
Genetic polymorphisms yield regional differences in brain anatomy and function across 
individuals. Neurotransmission affects neurotrophic factors that control structural growth 
and synaptic proliferation/pruning during development. Caudate but not prefrontal volume 
was reduced in homozygous 10-repeat DAT1 carriers [ Durston et al., 2005 ], whereas 
prefrontal cortex but not caudate was influenced by inheriting the DRD4 7-repeat allele 
[Shaw et al., 2007b ]; right ventral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex were 
thinner in those subjects with ADHD. In contrast to regional selectivity in structural 
findings, fMRI studies suggest more pervasive differences. A preliminary fMRI study found 
reduced caudate and greater cerebellar activation in children with ADHD and their 
unaffected siblings who were 10-repeat DAT1 homozygotes relative to heterozygotes 
[Durston et al., 2008 ]. In healthy adults, frontal activation was reduced during working 
memory in 10-repeat DAT1 homozygotes [ Bertolino et al., 2006 ] and was increased in those 
without the 10-repeat allele (9/9 carriers [ Caldu et al., 2007 ]). Effects of DAT1 beyond the 
striatum, in prefrontal cortex where expression of DA transporters is low, suggests broad 
effects of genetic polymorphisms on functional networks rather than single regions.
In sum, phenotypic expression is likely to be mediated by endogenous and exogenous 
factors that induce variability in catecholaminergic function. In light of region-selective 
influence of catecholaminergic genetic polymorphisms, fMRI methods are well equipped to 
elucidate pathophysiological pathways for ADHD. Some promising directions for the future 
are discussed below.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
An approach that combines use of pharmacological fMRI emphasizing examination of 
functional connectivity and careful phenotypic description that incorporates symptom and 
genotype measures ought to be fruitful. fMRI probes should capitalize on knowledge from 
healthy cognition about processes mediated by individual regions (e.g., response selection in 
inferior frontal cortex, evaluative processes in orbitofrontal cortex) and small circuits (e.g., 
orbitofrontal–ventral striatal) to manipulate variables, to test specific functional predictions 
in ADHD. These experiments should incorporate the following design features. First, in 
light of dependency of catecholamine function on environmental context, it will be 
insightful to manipulate contextual variables. For example, holding cognitive load constant, 
parametric manipulation of motivation levels (e.g., by use of incentives) or saliency (e.g., 
perceptual task characteristics) will be useful to elucidate heterogeneity in activation 
patterns. Second, treating symptom expression as quantitative continuous factors will allow 
for identification of regions where activation varies by levels of inattention, impulsivity, or 
hyperactivity. Furthermore, characteristics of DA or NE transmission can be varied by 
systematic manipulation of allelic variation, especially in combinations of genes to examine 
additive effects. Third, anatomical studies point to significant variability in developmental 
trajectories, and therefore, fMRI studies should control age, either restricting it to narrow 
ranges (e.g., 8–10 years rather than 8–12 years) or examining age differences by design. 
Fourth, examination of resting state connectivity by samples grouped by DA/NE alleles will Vaidya and Stollstorff Page 10

Preliminary studies in ADHD suggest weak connectivity between medial frontal–parietal 
regions [ Castellanos et al., 2008 ]. Both regions are rich in NE and DA and differences by 
allelic variation would reveal baseline differences among ADHD subjects that relate to 
catecholaminergic function without heterogeneity induced by task factors.

on behalf of the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG)
Objective: The authors performed meta-analyses of ran-
domized controlled trials to examine the effects of cogni-
tive training on attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) symptoms, neuropsychological de ﬁcits, and ac-
ademic skills in children/adolescents with ADHD.
Method: The authors searched Pubmed, Ovid, Web of
Science, ERIC, and CINAHAL databases through May 18,2014. Data were aggregated using random-effects models.Studies were evaluated with the Cochrane risk of bias tool.
Results: Sixteen of 695 nonduplicate records were
analyzed (759 children with ADHD). When all types oftraining were considered together, there were signi ﬁcant
effects on total ADHD (standardized mean difference
[SMD] ¼0.37, 95% CI ¼0.09–0.66) and inattentive
symptoms (SMD ¼0.47, 95% CI ¼0.14–0.80) for reports
by raters most proximal to the treatment setting (i.e.,
typically unblinded). These ﬁgures decreased substan-
tially when the outcomes were provided by probablyblinded raters (ADHD total: SMD ¼0.20, 95% CI ¼0.01–
0.40; inattention: SMD ¼0.32, 95% CI ¼/C00.01 to 0.66).
Effects on hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms were notsigniﬁcant. There were signi ﬁcant effects on laboratory
tests of working memory (verbal: SMD ¼0.52, 95% CI ¼
0.24–0.80; visual: SMD ¼0.47, 95% CI ¼0.23–0.70) and
parent ratings of executive function (SMD ¼0.35, 95%
CI¼0.08–0.61). Effects on academic performance were not
statistically signi ﬁcant. There were no effects of working
memory training, speci ﬁcally on ADHD symptoms. In-
terventions targeting multiple neuropsychological de ﬁcits
had large effects on ADHD symptoms rated by most
proximal assessors (SMD ¼0.79, 95% CI ¼0.46–1.12).
Conclusion: Despite improving working memory per-
formance, cognitive training had limited effects on ADHDsymptoms according to assessments based on blinded
measures. Approaches targeting multiple neuropsycho-
logical processes may optimize the transfer of effects fromcognitive de ﬁcits to clinical symptoms.

Attention-de ﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a
childhood-onset condition characterized by perva-
sive patterns of inattention and/or impulsivity-
hyperactivity that often persist into later life.1Combinations
of pharmacological and psychological approaches are rec-ommended for its treatment.
2Although medication is ef ﬁ-
cacious in randomized controlled trials (RCT) in the short/
medium-term and is indicated as the ﬁrst-line treatment
(at least for severe cases2), it has a number of potential
limitations —each affecting some patients. These include the
following: partial response or nonresponse3;p o s s i b l ea d v e r s eeffects4; uncertainty about long-term costs and bene ﬁts5;p o o r
adherence6; and negative medication-related attitudes from
patients, parents, or clinicians.7Psychological treatments such
as behavioral parent training are also widely used. However,a recent meta-analysis
8found no effects on ADHD symptoms
when only ratings by assessors blind to treatment allocation
were considered.
In recent years, cognitive training has been investigated
as a potential ADHD treatment.9Building on evidence of
brain plasticity from rehabilitation science and contempo-
rary developmental neuroscience, cognitive training is pre-mised on the notion that key brain networks implicated in
ADHD can be strengthened, and the cognitive processes
they subserve improved, through controlled exposures toinformation processing tasks.
10Thus, it is argued that
cognitive training can reduce ADHD symptoms and
improve functioning by targeting neuropsychological de ﬁ-
cits thought to mediate ADHD pathophysiology. In keepingThis article can be used to obtain continuing medical education (CME)

"with the complex nature of ADHD neuropsychology,11
cognitive training approaches have targeted a range of def-
icits (e.g., attentional control, working memory, inhibitorycontrol). Currently, such training is typically delivered via
computers using adaptive procedures, whereby training task
difﬁculty is automatically increased across sessions to
continually challenge the patient at the boundaries of his or
her competence. This has been shown in neuroimaging
studies to be necessary for sustaining neuronal changes.
12,13
The ef ﬁcacy of cognitive training for ADHD was addressed
in a meta-analysis of nonpharmacological treatments for
ADHD by Sonuga-Barke et al.14on behalf of the European
ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG). This meta-analysis focused
solely on RCTs. Importantly, it addressed the issue of blinding
by comparing outcomes rated by individuals most proximal tothe therapeutic setting (often unblinded and invested in thepatient and/or intervention) and those provided by reporters
judged to be probably blinded. Effects of cognitive training on
ADHD symptoms calculated using unblinded ratings werehighly signi ﬁcant (standardized mean difference [SMD] ¼0.64,
95% CI ¼0.33–0.95). These effects dropped substantially
(SMD ¼0.24) and became statistically nonsigni ﬁcant (95%
CI¼/C00.24 to 0.72) when probably blinded measures were
used. However, these results should be considered as pre-
liminary because only 6 RCTs were included. The authorsconcluded that more evidence was required, especially fromtrials in which assessments were effectively blinded, before
cognitive training could be supported as an ADHD treatment.
A second meta-analysis by Rapport et al. ,
9published more
recently and exploring a wider range of outcomes, found
similar effects. However, compared to Sonuga-Barke et al.,14
this more recent meta-analysis included only 2 additional
peer-reviewed RCTs with outcomes related to ADHD core
symptoms. Moreover, to increase statistical power, Rapport
et al.9also included non-RCTs and pooled across design types,
making effect size estimates of the effects of cognitive training
on ADHD core symptoms and related neuropsychological
impairment dif ﬁcult to interpret.
A signi ﬁcant number of new RCTs of cognitive training
for ADHD, not available for inclusion in these previous 2
meta-analyses,9,14have been published in the past 2 years,
reﬂecting the current interest in cognitive training in this
ﬁeld. The greater number of trials now available allows a
much more de ﬁnitive estimate of the effects of cognitive
training to be made. In the present article, we update the ﬁrst
EAGG cognitive training meta-analysis to include these new
trials, and we extend its focus to cover effects on neuro-
psychological processes and academic functioning, whichwere not addressed in the previous EAGG meta-analysis.
14
The focus on neuropsychological processes is important for2 reasons. First, neuropsychological de ﬁcits are postulated to
mediate the pathways between originating causes and dis-order onset: improvements in neuropsychological func-
tioning may therefore be a prerequisite for ADHD symptom
reduction.
15Second, they are associated with functional
impairments in their own right, independent of their asso-
ciation with ADHD symptomatology, especially in social
and academic contexts.16A broad range of training ap-
proaches have been used with ADHD populations. In themeta-analysis by Sonuga-Barke et al. ,14given the small
number of studies available, trials with different techniqueshad to be pooled to generate an effect size estimate. How-ever, given the increased number of trials now available, our
aim was to explore training-type speci ﬁc effects through the
use of subanalyses where suf ﬁcient numbers of trials existed.
METHOD
The EAGG protocol for nonpharmacological interventions for
ADHD was registered on the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews PROSPERO (http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/
PROSPERO, protocol number: CRD42011001393). The same proto-col was followed here.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Only RCTs including interventions aimed to directly train a cogni-tive function were retained. As reported by the Cochrane group,
17to
ensure high levels of methodological adequacy and to avoid the
inevitable bias caused by dependence on investigators agreeing toprovide data from unpublished studies, only published studies were
included. Trials were included if participants had an ADHD diag-
nosis (any subtype) or met accepted cut-offs on validated ADHDrating scales and were between 3 and 18 years of age. Trialsinvolving children with ADHD comorbid with rare disorders (e.g.,
fragile X syndrome) only were excluded. Control conditions allowed
were “treatment as usual, ”“wait list, ”“active/placebo/sham ”(i.e.,
involving other forms of computer-based activity or alternativetraining regimen). Trials were not excluded if patients received
medication as part of normal treatment. In an extension of the
EAGG protocol,
14trials could be included in this updated meta-
analysis despite not reporting an ADHD outcome if they reportedneuropsychological and/or academic outcomes.
Search Strategy
Sonuga-Barke et al.14included studies up to April 3, 2012. Here,
using the same search strategy, our ﬁnal search date was May 18,
2014. Supplement 1, available online, reports details about thesearch strategy and syntax for each database. Parallel searches were
conducted separately by the ﬁrst 2 authors.
Outcome Measures
For consistency with previous EAGG meta-analyses8and to provide
a robust estimate of effects, outcome domains were analyzed only if
5 or more RCTs were available. The outcomes analyzed were: ADHDsymptoms (total ADHD as well as inattention and hyperactivity/
impulsivity symptoms), parent ratings of executive functioning (e.g.,
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function [BRIEF]), standard-ized measures of reading and arithmetic ability, and laboratory-basedmeasures of verbal and visual working memory, inhibition, and atten-
tion. For neuropsychological outcomes, only scores from tasks different
from those used for training were included in the analysis.
Study Selection
Articles ’titles and abstracts were screened independently by the ﬁrst
2 authors. Final inclusion was based on the full text. Trials wereblindly double coded for eligibility by the ﬁrst 2 authors (S.C., M.F).
Disagreement was resolved by the senior author for 3 trials.
Risk of Bias Assessment
Two authors independently assessed trial risk of bias using 5 do-
mains of the Cochrane Collaborations tool17: namely, selection bias,
performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, and other bias. If
JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD&ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
VOLUME 54 NUMBER 3 MARCH 2015 www.jaacap.org 165COGNITIVE TRAINING IN ADHD",paper5.pdf,2
"there was disagreement between the 2 raters, the ﬁnal rating was
established through consensus with the involvement of the seniorauthor. This occurred for 4 trials.
Data Extraction and Statistical Analysis
Trial information was entered into RevMan 5.0.18Data extraction
was independently performed and cross-checked by the ﬁrst 2 au-
thors. SMD was calculated as mean pre- to posttreatment change inthe intervention group minus the mean pre- to posttreatment changein the control group divided by the pooled pretest standard devia-
tion with a bias adjustment.
19SMDs for each trial were combined
using the inverse variance method. Given the inherent heterogeneityof studies, random effects models were used. The I
2statistic was
calculated a posteriori to estimate between-trial SMD heterogeneity.
For the most proximal analysis, parent ratings, if available, were
used for home-based interventions, and teacher ratings were usedfor school-based interventions, except when it could be inferredfrom the manuscript ’s text that teachers were less blinded than
parents for home-based interventions and parents less blinded than
teachers for school-based interventions (2 trials
20,21). Probably blin-
ded assessments were those made by an individual judged likely to
be unaware of treatment allocation. In trials in which more than 1
such measure was available, the best-blinded measure was chosen.For home-delivered interventions, teachers ’ratings were usuallyjudged to be blinded, whereas for school-based interventions, par-
ents were judged to be blinded except where this could be inferrednot to be the case from the text
20,21or from e-mail exchange with the
authors. As per protocol, where direct observations were available,
we selected these over rating-scale scores. This decision was based
on the judgement that direct observations are likely, in general, to bebetter blinded than parent- or teacher-rated outcomes, even when
the latter are made in a setting other than the therapeutic setting.
Where multiple measures were available for a single outcome (aswas sometimes the case for laboratory tasks), the measure mostfrequently reported across included trials and/or that which was
judged to tap the core of the construct was selected. Sensitivity an-
alyses were conducted including only trials meeting the followingcriteria: use of active/sham control; use of working memorytraining; use of training targeting more than 1 neuropsychological
domain (termed here “multiple process training ”); and use of no/
low medication (i.e., with <30% of participants receiving medica-
tions). We also performed an additional sensitivity analysis
excluding the study by Gray et al.,
22in which all participants had a
diagnosis of ADHD plus coexisting intellectual disability. Publica-tion bias was assessed with funnel plots and Egger ’s tests. Finally,
we also conducted a meta-regression analysis, using the metareg
command in STATA,
23to assess the relationship between age and
SMD for most proximal and probably blinded assessments ofADHD core symptoms. This analysis was conducted to establishFIGURE 1 Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) ﬂow diagram of selection of studies (last
search updated May 18, 2014). Note:aA total of 259 studies were not on attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); 342 were
not on cognitive training; 7 were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs); 47 were reviews; 3 were studies in adults; and 1 was a

RESULTS
Fifteen trials (reported in 16 papers) met entry criteria (see
Table S1, available online). Studies not included in the meta-
analysis are listed (with reasons for their exclusion) inTable S2 (available online). Figure 1 reports the trial selectionﬂowchart. Table 1 gives information about retained trials.
Results of all analyses are summarized in Table 2. Six trials
were on working memory training, 4 on attention training, 2combined attention and working memory training, 2 inhibi-
tion and working memory training, and 1 trial provided a
general executive function training covering working mem-ory, inhibition, and cognitive ﬂexibility. All training schedules
had an “adaptive ”component, that is, task dif ﬁculty was
increased across sessions to track performance improvement.Eight trials had an active control condition. Six trials wereimplemented at home, 5 at school, 2 at either school or home,1 trial in the clinic, and 1 at the welfare service/children
center, home or laboratory. Five trials had no/low medicationlevels. Figure S1 (available online) depicts the graphic outputfor the risk of bias assessment. Risk of bias was generally low
or unclear. No trials were scored as “high risk ”with regard to
“random sequence generation, ”“allocation concealment, ”
and “incomplete outcome data, ”and only 3 and 4 trials
scored high for “blinding of participants/personnel ”and
“blinding of outcome assessment, ”respectively (the rating of
each study is available upon request).
ADHD Symptoms
ADHD symptoms (total score or inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity separately) were an outcome in up to 14 trials.Probably blinded measures were available in up to 11 trials
(Table 2).
When most proximal assessments were the outcome, there
was a moderate but signi ﬁcant effect on total ADHD and in-
attention symptoms but no effecton hyperactivity/impulsivity

"(Figure 2; SMD and CI data for all outcomes are presented in
Table 2). In sensitivity analyses (Figures S2 and S3, availableonline), considering only trials with an active control, theeffects were no longer statistically signi ﬁcant for any ADHD
core symptoms outcomes. There was no effect of working
memory training when implemented on its own (Figures S2and S3, available online). In contrast, multi-process training
approaches (i.e., approaches targeting more than 1 neuropsy-
chological domain) gave a large effect size for total ADHDsymptoms (Figure S2, available online). Between-study
heterogeneity of effect sizes was high and signi ﬁcant for total
ADHD and inattention symptoms.
When analyses were restricted to probably blinded
measures (Figure 2), in general, effect sizes were reduced
with small and statistically marginal effects for all ADHDoutcomes. In a sensitivity analysis (Figure S4, available on-line), effect sizes dropped further to nonsigni ﬁcant levels
when only trials with an active control arm were included.
There were insuf ﬁcient studies (n <5) for an analysis of
probably blinded measures in multi-component training
trials, as well as for a number of other sensitivity analyses.
When analysis was restricted to no/low medication trials,
effects on total ADHD symptoms were not signi ﬁcant for either
most proximal or, when available, probably blinded assess-
ments in any ADHD core symptom –related outcome (Table 2).
Neuropsychological Outcomes
Eight trials included laboratory measures of verbal, and 5
trials visual working memory (Table 2). There was a largeand signi ﬁcant effect of cognitive training on both compo-
nents (Figure 3), which was maintained in sensitivity ana-lyses considering trials with active controls only or workingmemory training trials only (Figure S5, available online;
sensitivity analyses were not performed for visual working
memory because of an insuf ﬁcient number of trials). The
number of trials using multi-component training and no/
low medication trials was insuf ﬁcient to perform sensitivity
analyses. There were no signi ﬁcant effects of training on
laboratory tests of inhibition (6 trials) or attention (7 trials)
(Figure 3). Six trials included most proximal ratings of ex-
ecutive functioning using the BRIEF rating scale (Figure S6,available online). These demonstrated a small-to-moderate,
signiﬁcant SMD. There was an insuf ﬁcient number of trials
with ratings of executive functioning to perform plannedsensitivity analyses.
Academic Ability
Five trials included standardized measures of reading and 5of arithmetic. There were no signi ﬁcant effects in either
domain (Figure 3). There was an insuf ﬁcient number of trials
to perform planned sensitivity analyses.

"blinded raters, the test failed to reach the p<0.05 level,
suggesting no signi ﬁcant publication bias.
Meta-Regression Analysis
For most proximal or probably blinded assessments of
ADHD core symptoms, there was no signi ﬁcant effect of age
on SMD (see Supplement 3, available online).
Sensitivity Analysis Excluding the Study by Gray et al.22
The main results considering most proximal assessment of
ADHD core symptoms were substantially unchanged, as
reported in Figure S7 (available online). As this study was
not included in “probably blinded ”analyses, no sensitivity
analysis was conducted considering probably blinded
assessment.
DISCUSSION
There are 2 perspectives on cognitive training in ADHD.
From 1 perspective, cognitive training is a front-line ADHDtreatment: this is based on the hypothesis that because causal
pathways to disorder are mediated by neuropsychological
deﬁcits, strengthening de ﬁcient neuropsychological functions
should reduce ADHD symptoms and associated impairment.
From the second perspective, it is perceived as an adjunctive
treatment that reduces impairment associated with neuro-psychological de ﬁcits commonly seen in children with
ADHD, independent of any effects on core ADHD symptoms
itself. The current meta-analysis, including an additional 10RCTs compared to the previous study by Sonuga-Barke
et al. ,
14provided little support for cognitive training as a
front-line ADHD treatment. There were statistically signi ﬁ-
cant effects on ADHD symptoms when considering raters
most proximal to treatment delivery, especially for symp-
toms of inattention. However, these effects were reducedsubstantially when analyses were limited to trials with anactive control arm or where assessors were probably blind to
treatment allocation. The evidence was somewhat stronger
for the bene ﬁts of cognitive training as an adjunctive treat-
ment aimed at reducing neuropsychological impairment.
There were large and highly signi ﬁcant improvements on
objective tests of both visual and verbal working memory,although there were no effects on inhibition or inattention.
Furthermore, the effects of cognitive training on working
memory did not extend to the academic outcomes explored.
The substantial drop in SMDs between most proximal
and probably blinded analyses for ADHD symptoms is
similar to the pattern seen in previous meta-analyses ofnonpharmacological treatments using the EAGG protocol(e.g., behavioral intervention;
8neurofeedback14). This is
probably caused by the in ﬂation of effect size estimates that
inevitably occurs when one relies on raters who are bothlikely to be aware of treatment allocation and heavily
invested in the delivery and outcome of treatment. It is also
possible that probably blinded and most proximal assess-ments differed in some way that reduced the sensitivity of
the former to treatment-related change. However, the same
measurement approaches were used for each (some parent,FIGURE 3 Forest plots for meta-analysis of effects on neuropsychological and academic outcomes. Note: Cogn ¼cognitive;
std¼standard.

"some teacher, and some direct observation measures).
Another possibility is that most proximal assessmentsaccurately captured treatment effects established in thetherapeutic setting but that these effects did not generalize to
the settings in which probably blinded assessments were
made. However, in a substantial minority of trials (Table 1),especially those with an active control arm, probably blin-
ded measures were collected in the treatment setting, and
the effects for these trials were no larger than those for trialsin which they were collected in a different setting.
The trials included in the meta-analysis used a wide
range of training approaches targeting different neuropsy-chological processes. There was a suf ﬁcient number of trials
to look at 2 classes of intervention individually, which was
not possible in the previous meta-analysis by Sonuga-Barkeet al.
14: namely, training of working memory only, and
training focusing on multiple neuropsychological domains.
The results for trials implementing working memory
training only departed in a striking way from the mostproximal/probably blinded pattern described above. Effects
on ADHD were negligible even considering most proximal
measures. This suggests that this form of training, which hasbeen widely promoted for use with patients with ADHD (as
discussed by Rapport et al.,
9), has little or no ef ﬁcacy for core
ADHD symptoms. On the other hand, the SMD for mostproximal assessment of ADHD symptoms was substantiallylarger for trials based on training targeting multiple domains
than for all studies as a whole. Unfortunately, there was an
insufﬁcient number of trials (n ¼4) with probably blinded
measures to corroborate these effects using independent
sources. The superiority of these approaches may be due to
the typically greater number of training sessions in multi-compared to single-component approaches (in our analysis,
an average of 9 weeks compared to 6 weeks, respectively).
However, the ﬁnding opens up the interesting possibility that
multi-component training models may be more successful for
ADHD, given the complex and heterogeneous nature of the
condition. Because children with ADHD differ from oneanother in their neuropsychological pro ﬁle, and because
children may be affected by more than 1 de ﬁcit,
37,38multi-
component training may be used to target a series of neuro-
psychological domains that may be more important thanworking memory alone in the pathophysiology of ADHD
symptoms. The development and evaluation of multi-
component training models should be a future priority.
The effects on neuropsychological outcomes were
restricted to working memory, which were substantial, with
no effects on inhibitory or attentional control. There weresigniﬁcant effects on parents ’ratings of executive function,
but these could not be corroborated by independent blinded
evidence. All 6 trials that included a working memoryoutcome were working memory training trials. Therefore,although these trials produced “near transfer ”of training
effects to untrained working memory measures, there was
no evidence of “far transfer ”to other neuropsychological
processes. Crucially, there was also no evidence that these
effects generalized to important areas of everyday func-
tioning, which themselves are in ﬂuenced by working
memory ability,
16such as reading and arithmetic. Thisﬁnding may be relevant in clinical practice. Indeed, parents
may currently favor cognitive training with the hope thatthey can improve academic performance. Our results showthat this is not supported by empirical evidence.
The success of working memory training in improving
working memory performance draws into even sharper re-lief its failure to improve ADHD symptoms, suggesting
dissociation between neuropsychological functioning and
disorder. There are 4 possible explanations for this: ﬁrst, that
working memory de ﬁcits do not, in fact, mediate ADHD
pathophysiology
39; second, that although they do mediate
the development of ADHD, they have become entrenchedand not susceptible to the type of training implemented in
trials conducted to date; third, that training as currently
implemented targets types of working memory not funda-mental to the de ﬁcits in ADHD
9; and fourth, that training
produces only peripheral, practice-like effects on working
memory, with no profound impact on the brain networks
underpinning neuropsychological de ﬁcits responsible for
ADHD. Whether or not working memory de ﬁcits are part of
the causal mechanism underpinning ADHD, based on our
results, strengthening working memory appears to beneither a necessary nor a suf ﬁcient condition for ADHD
symptom reduction. In this regard, our ﬁndings suggest that
choosing substrates that have emerged from experimentalresearch as treatment targets may not necessarily translateinto clinical bene ﬁts. This possible dissociation between
candidate mechanisms of a disorder and clinical targets is
important when adopting pathophysiology-based researchapproaches such as the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC).
40
From a clinical standpoint, developing techniques to extendtransfer from the effects on core working memory processesto broader neuropsychological processes and important
domains of impairment and/or clinical presentation is the
most pressing challenge for the future. The reasons for thelack of effect on inhibitory and attentional control are hard to
determine on the basis of the current analysis, given the
small number of trials that speci ﬁcally targeted these do-
mains. Although we might predict that training targetingmultiple de ﬁcit domains would show effects on these neu-
ropsychological processes, there were insuf ﬁcient trials with
multi-component training and measures of inhibition and/or attention to test this. Approaches focusing on motiva-
tional or energetic processes may also be valuable (i.e.,
training to increase delay of grati ﬁcation).
41
A number of limitations need to be taken into account when
interpreting the current analysis. First, there was signi ﬁcant
SMD heterogeneity for some analyses (most proximal totalADHD, symptoms of inattention, and visual working mem-
ory). This leaves open the possibility that cognitive training
may be effective under speci ﬁc circumstances in individual
trials. Given the limited number of trials available, we wereunable to identify speci ﬁc features of positive trials (apart from
therapeutic content, working memory training). Second, only
a minority of trials (n ¼5) reported using intention-to-treat
analyses, a situation that may have in ﬂated the effects for
some outcomes, as participants who are more dif ﬁcult to treat
or who perceive the treatment as less bene ﬁcial may drop out
of trials; however, drop-out was relatively low in most trials.

"Third, despite the recent substantial increase in the number of
available cognitive training trials, there was an insuf ﬁcient
number of trials to evaluate training approaches targetingspeciﬁc neuropsychological constructs other than working
memory training. Fourth, there were insuf ﬁcient trials to run
analyses for some important outcomes (e.g., functionalimpairment, IQ), as well as for sensitivity analyses or analyses
restricted to probably blinded measures for a number of out-
comes. Fifth, too few trials included long-term outcomes(Table 1) to allow an evaluation of the extent to which effects on
clinical symptoms grew over time or effects on neuropsycho-
logical processes persisted. Sixth, no trials were restricted toindividuals with both ADHD and the speci ﬁc neuropsycho-
logical de ﬁcit to be trained. As a consequence, effect sizes for
both neuropsychological de ﬁcits and ADHD symptoms may
have been truncated: in the former case because there would belittle room for improvement where no de ﬁcit existed; in
the latter case because targeting a neuropsychological de ﬁcit
that was not causing the condition would be unlikely to reducesymptoms of the core condition. Seventh, in the neuropsy-
chological domains, diverse measures from different tasks (still
tapping the same domain, however) were combined acrossstudies to allow the calculation of pooled SMD estimates.
Eighth, it is important to understand whether initial symptom-
related and neuropsychological treatment effects persist overtime and generalize to other domains, if they do. There wereinsufﬁcient trials that examined long-term outcomes to
address this issue. Finally, the categorization of studies as
“probably blinded, ”although carried out according to previ-
ously agreed and clear decision rules set out in the protocol, is
limited by an inevitable degree of uncertainty because of lim-
itations in the information reported in some trials.
In summary, the current meta-analysis found limited
evidence for the clinical value of cognitive training for chil-
dren with ADHD outside of the narrow con ﬁnes of speci ﬁc
targeted neuropsychological processes (i.e., working mem-
ory training improved working memory function). Given the
evidence for neuropsychological heterogeneity in ADHD,future efforts should be directed at developing protocols totarget a broader range of neuropsychological de ﬁcits.
Furthermore, therapeutic innovation is required to enhance
the“far transfer ”of speci ﬁc neuropsychological gains to
everyday patterns of functional impairment through more
ecologically valid training approaches.
42Future trials should
more consistently include active control arms, a broaderrange of functional outcomes, and long-term follow-up. &

"CURRENTOPINION Updates in technology-based interventions for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Choon Guan Lim, Nikki S.J. Lim-Ashworth, and Daniel S.S. Fung
Purpose of review
Technological advancement has led to the development of novel treatment approaches for attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review aims to review recent studies which employ the use of
technology to treat ADHD, with particular focus on studies published during a 1-year period fromFebruary 2019 to February 2020.
Recent findings
Most recent studies involved children aged 12 years and below. Interventions included cognitive training
through games, neurofeedback and a combination of several approaches. More novel approaches included
trigeminal nerve stimulation and brain–computer interface, and studies had utilized technology such as X-boxKinect and eye tracker. There was a shift towards delivering intervention at home and in school, enabled by
technology. The study outcomes were variable and mainly included executive functioning measures and
clinical ratings. These interventions were generally safe with few reported adverse events.
Summary
Technology has enabled interventions to be delivered outside of the clinic setting and presented anopportunity for increased access to care and early intervention. Better quality studies are needed to inform
on the efficacy of these interventions.
Keywords
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, attention training, cognitive training
INTRODUCTION
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is
among the most prevalent child psychiatric condi-tions [1–4]. This neurodevelopmental disorder canpersist into adulthood and result in significant
adverse health and psychosocial outcomes including
higher incidence of comorbid mental health disor-ders, occupational difficulties and marital conflicts;hence ADHD is associated with significant burden[5–7]. Pharmacological and psychosocial interven-tions are the main evidence-based approaches [8–11]. However, due to the limitations associated withthese treatments including undesirable side effects,
an intense level of commitment and unclear long-
term benefits, alternatives which are effective, safeand cost-efficient are needed [12–14].
Understanding the pathophysiology of ADHD is
necessary to enable the search for other interventionapproaches (Fig. 1). Although stimulant and non-stimulant medications correct the underlying neu-rochemical (catecholamine) deficit, neuroimaging
studies have helped identify affected brain networks
in ADHD. These include the ventral attention, fron-toparietal, default mode and visual networks [15
&].ADHD has long been associated with executive func-
tion deficits including organization, working mem-ory and inhibition [16,17]. Cognitive training couldreducing these deficits by strengthening key neuralnetworks, leading to overall functional improvement[18,19]. Neurofeedback therapy targets electroen-cephalogram (EEG) abnormalities such as excessivecortical slowing and increased theta waves (with
corresponding reduced beta-theta ratios), another
reflection of the underlying network abnormalities[20–23]. Neurofeedback therapy has been shown tostrengthen the brain’s attentional circuits [24
&].

"Others have examined the use of physical exercise
which can lead to neuroplastic changes and neuro-physiological changes such as increased levels offronto-striatal catecholamines [25,26].
Technological advancement has led to more
specific adaption of intervention options for ADHD.
Indeed, progress in technology has reduced thereliance on mental health professionals to adminis-ter intervention and allowed for a more cost-effec-tive and flexible delivery of treatment [27]. In theirreview of technology-based care for ADHD, Benya-korn et al. [28] categorized the use of technologyinto direct care provision (e.g. computerized cogni-
tive training) and supporting care provision (e.g.
health information technology). It is critical to fullyunderstand the emerging evidence around thedomains of ADHD difficulties in which technologyhas been applied to address, describe associated keyfindings, as well as identify any limitations. Thisrapid review will provide an update to the currentempirical base by identifying research involving
technology for treating ADHD, with particular focus
on the preceding 1-year period.
METHOD
Studies were identified through a systematic searchacross the following electronic databases: Psy-cINFO and MEDLINE. The search terms used were
(attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) in combi-
nation with (intervention, programme, treatment,training, therapy) and (computer, Internet, tech-nology, video, online). The respective terms withtruncation were first searched and subsequentlycombined using Boolean searching. Specific keywords were also identified in empirical articlesarising from the initial search, and further searches
utilized combinations of the following search
string: neurofeedback OR electroencephalogramOR transcranial-magnetic OR brain OR executivefunction OR cognition OR virtual reality ORaugmented reality.
A study was deemed to be suitable for inclusion
if it met the following criteria:
(1) Examined the effectiveness of a technology-
based intervention for ADHD,KEY POINTS
/C15Technology can be used to develop interventions which
can train and modulate the affected neural networks in
ADHD, through targeting neuropsychological and
neurophysiological deficits.
/C15Current interventions involve training multiple cognitive
domains or including a combination of approaches
such as cognitive training, neurofeedback and physical
exercise.
/C15There is a clear shift towards delivering intervention at
home or even in school, which improves access to care
and can be more cost-effective.
/C15Technology can enable interventions to be more
personalized and be delivered further upstream.
/C15There is a need for better quality studies to properly
evaluate the efficacy of most interventions, especially
for outcomes like functional improvement and longer
term benefits.

"RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Digital interventions and serious games
With today’s connected youths, cognitive training
through games may be more engaging [29–33].Termed ‘serious games’ due to their training purposerather than for entertainment, these digital games forADHD can train several cognitive domains [34]. Theycan also incorporate biofeedback, virtual reality andaugmented reality to facilitate mastery and transfereffect to untrained domains and ultimately, to daily
life situations [35–38]. Such digital training has been
shown to lead to EEG changes in the prefrontal cortex[39]. Reviews of previous studies on serious games forADHD had cited concern regarding the limited qual-ity of most studies [40
&,41].
Kollins et al. [42&] reported their large random-
ized, double blind, parallel-group, controlled trialinvolving 346 children aged 8–12 years. The inter-
vention programme was a home-based digital game
with cognitive training components involvingattention control and set shifting, within builtreal-time adaptive mechanism to personalize thetraining level. Although there was evidence of effec-tive attention control (i.e. near transfer effect) post-intervention, these skill set was not generalized tonew contextual settings (far transfer effect).
Studies have examined metacognitive therapy
in adults with ADHD [43
&]. To enhance far transfer
skills, Capodieci et al. [44] incorporated metacogni-
tive elements such as active reflection and promo-tion of self-awareness to the working memorytraining tasks. Their open-label study suggested thatboth children with ADHD and typically developingchildren showed some transfer effect to other exec-
utive functions after intervention, with the ADHD
group showing improved behavioural rating.
Cognitive therapy may be more beneficial for a
subgroup of children with ADHD, especially thosewith more severe executive function deficit [45–48].Dovis et al. tested this hypothesis in their placebo-
controlled study to elucidate the effect of pretrain-ing executive function as a moderator of outcome of
a gamified home-based 5-week training programme.
However, those with poorer pretraining workingmemory and inhibition did not benefit more [49].
In an interesting study conducted in a classroom
setting, teachers delivered the gamified attentiontraining to students aged 5–9 years. Compared withthe control groups, students in the interventiongroup showed improved attention and hyperactiv-
ity ratings, even at 6 months’ follow-up, although
there were no cognitive or academic gains [50
&].
Although the study did not specifically enrol chil-dren with ADHD, it represents an opportunity forupstream school-based intervention.Earlier studies have shown that cognitive train-
ing results in increased activation in related brain
regions [51,52]. In their functional MRI study ofchildren with ADHD, de Oliveira Rosa et al. [53
&]
found that those who received cognitive trainingand stimulant medication showed greater activa-tion of the right fronto-parietal brain areas thatmediate sustained attention after intervention,compared with those who received nonactive com-
puterized intervention with stimulant medication.
This added further evidence that cognitive trainingcould normalize neural circuits in childrenwith ADHD.
Future cognitive training programmes should
involve several cognitive domains, be personalizedto the individual needs and ability, include compo-nents to increase engagement as well as promote
transfer of skills to daily tasks. Delivering interven-
tions at home and in school can increase access tointervention and promote upstream intervention.
Neurofeedback and related therapy
Standard neurofeedback treatment protocolsinclude sensori-motor rhythm neurofeedback,
theta/beta neurofeedback and slow cortical poten-
tial neurofeedback [54]. Though many studies havereported positive results, reviews have highlightedthe need for better quality studies, need to examinelonger term efficacy and the lack of standardizedtraining for therapists [55–59].
An alternative approach is Z-score neurofeed-
back which is less studied [60]. Groeneveld et al. [61]
combined Z-score neurofeedback and heart rate
variability training (biofeedback) in their studyinvolving both adults and children with clinicaland subclinical ADHD symptoms. They reportedimprovement in behavioural symptoms and nor-malization of EEG postintervention.
A novel brain computer interface-based inter-
vention used machine learning technique to
develop a unique algorithm utilizing the entire
EEG spectrum, with feedback and training activitiesincorporated into a game [62–64]. Academic taskswere included to promote skills transfer. Their largerandomized wait-list control trial involving 172children aged 6–12 years diagnosed with ADHDfound the effect size of the intervention was small,based on blinded clinician ratings [65
&]. A subgroup
of the children underwent neuroimaging, which
revealed that those with improved behavioural rat-ing tended to exhibit increased functional networkreorganization, especially within the salience/ven-tral attention network [66].
As we move towards personalized medicine,
further research can uncover predictors of positiveUpdates in technology-based interventions Guan Lim et al.

"response to neurofeedback [67]. Technology
advancement has boosted the ease of programmed
home-based neurofeedback treatment, removingthe need for therapist training [68]. For instance,the multichannel EEG cap has now been replaced bythe more user-friendly headband utilizing muchfewer channels. One study to look out for is Bioulac’shead-to-head clinical trial comparing a novel home-based neurofeedback intervention with long-acting
methylphenidate [69].
Technology-assisted delivery of standard
treatment
Telehealth has been on the rise to improve access to
mental healthcare, as communication technologylike videoconferencing improves. Synonymous
terms include telepsychiatry and telemental health.
Telepsychiatry can be an effective way to deliver carefor ADHD [70–74]. A review has concluded thattelemedicine was cost-effective for children andsuggested that research should also be conductedin adults with ADHD [75]. In the pipeline, there is arandomized controlled trial underway to investigatethe efficacy of a web-assisted self-help programme
for parents of children with ADHD [76].
Mobile apps have been developed to support
young persons and their caregivers includingparents, teachers and professionals, as well as adultswith ADHD [77,78]. Despite the large number ofapps available, they may not necessarily match theusers’ needs and there has been little research doneto properly evaluate them [79,80
&].
Biederman’s study found that text messages
could significantly improve timely refill of pre-scriptions in adult patients with ADHD [81]. Theuse of readily available technology can facilitatemore effective delivery of evidence-based inter-vention and are potential quality improvementprojects.
Multidomain approaches
Technology can combine the training of multipledomains into a seamless programme. In their ran-domized waitlist control trial, Johnstone et al. [82]
tested a home-based gamified intervention com-bining working memory, inhibitory control andn e u r o f e e d b a c ki n8 5c h i l d r e na g e d7– 1 2w i t hc l i n i -c a la n ds u b c l i n i c a lA D H D .B e h a v i o u r a li m p r o v e -
ment did not reach significance and the children
became less engaged with further sessions. Simi-larly, Rajabi et al. [83] studied combined cognitive
training and neurofeedback, and their sampleimproved in behavioural ratings and visual atten-tion, compared with untreated controls. We arelikely to see more similar multimodal intervention
emerging.
Cognitively engaging physical exercise can
increase cognitive performance in ADHD possiblythrough training the brain regions involved inhigher order cognition [84,85]. Benzing andSchmidt [86] developed a home-based ‘exergaming’intervention and tested the 8-week programme in51 children aged 8–12 in their randomized waitlist-
control study. Utilizing X-box Kinect to control
movement, these adaptive games train strength,coordination and endurance, as well as cognitivefunctions of inhibition, attention and set shifting.The intervention group improved in their executivefunctions (inhibition, switching, updating), generalpsychopathology and motor abilities comparedwith the control group. In their multisite study,
Smith et al. [87] combined computerized cognitive
training and physical exercises in their intervention,which was delivered in a classroom setting by teach-ers and therapists. Their behaviour ratings at the endof the study did not differ from the control groupwhich received psychosocial and or pharmacologi-cal interventions.
Other approaches
Neurostimulation induces longer term changes inbrain excitability or neurotransmission through theapplication of electrical or magnetic stimulation[88
&]. Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) can acti-
vate higher brain centres through the nerve’s pro-jections, including those involved in ADHD such as
the locus coeruleus, thalamus and anterior cingu-
late cortex [89,90]. The Monarch external TNS Sys-tem became the first medical device for treatingADHD to receive marketing authorization fromthe US Food and Drug Administration, based onthe study by McGough et al. [91]. They conducted a
blinded sham-controlled trial and randomized 62children 8–12 years old with ADHD to 4 weeks of
nightly treatment with active TNS or sham treat-
ment [92
&]. The intervention group improved sig-
nificantly in their behavioural and clinical ratings.Though well tolerated, it remains to be seen if theresults can be replicated in other clinical trials, andwhether any improvement can be sustainedover time.
Garcı´a-Baos et al. [93
&] hypothesized that eye gaze
can therefore be a proxy measure for attention and
inhibitory control. They designed a computerizedgame which utilized an eye tracker, to train thechild’s visual attention control, to influence theattention network. The intervention group, whencompared with the control group playing the samegame without the eye tracker, showed improvementChild and adolescent psychiatry

"in their impulsivity, reaction time and gaze control.
More studies will be needed to support this approach.
Time estimation has recently gained interest,
with studies suggesting interval-timing dysfunctionbeing associated with ADHD [94–96]. In their studyinvolving young adults with ADHD, Fontes et al.
[97] showed, in their crossover study, that a trainingprogramme involving time estimation exposuretasks was promising in improving ADHD symptoms
and cognitive function.
Monitoring sensors such as accelerometer and
technology such as smartglassees were previouslystudied [98]. Sluiter et al. [99] used a timer to regu-
larly remind seven students with ADHD in a specialneeds classroom to monitor their on-task behaviour.Although their observed off-task behaviour was sig-nificantly reduced, most of their executive func-
tions did not improve except for inhibition. This
approach is not likely to be a primary treatment butmay be a tool to aid behavioural managementin ADHD.
CONCLUSION
The use of technology has moved intervention forADHD towards becoming home-based and evenschool-based, with the potential for individualiza-tion of treatment, improved access to care and earlyintervention. This exciting development is in theright direction towards personalized medicine andpopulation health. The lack of high-quality trials toprovide more reliable evidence for the efficacy of
most intervention remains a significant challenge.
More rigorous studies will be needed to inform uswhether technology-based advancement contrib-utes positively towards the accessibility of earlyintervention as well as the efficacy and challengesof home-based intervention. In addition, a combi-nation of interventional components, and individ-ualization of treatment appears feasible and may
be promising.

  Abstract
Mainstream approaches to treating Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder 
in children include stimulant medication such as methylphenidate and behavior therapy that target deficits in attention as well as inappropriate behaviors but do not sufficiently address the multiple cognitive deficits associated with the disorder. Deficits beyond attention have been identified in ADHD including working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed. As key elements of cognition and intelligence that contribute to thinking and learning, these are critical deficits found in children with ADHD that must be addressed.  In this review, we discuss existing research on cognitive training interventions for ADHD and evaluate their ability to target these multiple cognitive deficits as well as their ability to promote self-efficacy, social cognition, and motivation during training. We describe research on LearningRx, a clinician-delivered cognitive training intervention and suggest that human delivery enhances motivation and promotes social cognition and self-efficacy while strengthening weak cognitive skills associated with ADHD in children.  
Introduction
More than 6 million children in the United States are 
diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a 
neurodevelopmental condition defined by a persistent pattern of inattention—with or without hyperactivity—that interferes with daily functioning and typical development
1.  Children diagnosed 
with ADHD often struggle with time management problems, disorganization, low tolerance for frustration, and impulsive behaviors
2; and have a 40% less chance of graduating from 
high school3, as well as a greater risk for incarceration, teenage 
pregnancy, substance abuse, car accidents, and personal injury4.  
The economic impact of ADHD is upwards of 266 billion dollars a year on diagnosis, treatment, educational interventions, and lost wages and productivity in adulthood
5.  The standard of care for 
ADHD is stimulant medication or behavioral therapy, but a large number of children fail to respond to either treatment
6.  Perhaps 
the reason for this failure lies in the targets of treatment.  This 
mini-review addresses 1) how cognitive deficits in ADHD extend beyond attention, 2) implications for cognitive training treatment approaches to remediating multiple cognitive deficits and 3) future directions for the field.  
Cognitive Deficits Beyond Attention in ADHD
According to the ever-evolving Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of 
cognition—a widely-accepted explanation of intelligence and the ",paper7.pdf,1

Page 4 of 8basis of most intelligence tests—there are multiple broad 
cognitive abilities that determine the capacity to think 
and learn: fluid reasoning, short-term working memory with attentional control, learning efficiency, visual-spatial processing, auditory processing, retrieval fluency, processing speed, reaction speed, and psychomotor speed in addition to many more narrow cognitive abilities such as attentional control, attentional fluency, associative memory, working memory capacity, perceptual speed, and phonetic coding, for example
7.  Although a comprehensive 
discussion of each ability is beyond the scope of this review, it is critical to note the complexity and quantity of cognitive abilities that comprise overall cognition and intelligence.  Like tools in a toolbox, these many skills work together along with acquired knowledge to build the child’s capacity for thinking and learning.  
The definition and label of ADHD imply that attention 
is the primary cognitive deficit among children with the diagnosis.  However, we find this label to be inconsistent with research on cognitive deficits in children and adults with ADHD.  In the largest study of its kind, Moore and Ledbetter
8 created cognitive profiles of ADHD based on 
gold-standard testing of more than 5,000 children and adults with an existing diagnosis of ADHD.  We discovered that attention was not the most deficient cognitive skill.  Instead, the largest deficits were found in working memory, long-term memory, and processing speed for both children and adults.  Except for a brief and minimal decline in attention during the teenage years, attention remains steadily stronger than memory and processing speed across age groups.  Figure 1 illustrates the findings from ages 4 through 40.  These findings align with other research on 
individual cognitive skill deficits in ADHD, including those of a meta-analysis by Martinussen and colleagues
9 that 
revealed moderate to large impairments in both spatial 
and verbal working memory across 26 studies of ADHD. Cook and colleagues
10 found significant processing speed 
deficits in ADHD that also correlated with poor academic skills.  Their findings were consistent with several earlier studies with similar results: lower processing speed scores among children with ADHD compared to controls
11,12. Taken 
together, these studies suggest that if we want to treat the cognitive problems associated with ADHD effectively, we 
have to look beyond attention.  
Trends in Treatment Targets for ADHD
Despite the growing knowledge that deficits in ADHD 
extend beyond attention and focus, widespread treatment 
efforts target attention to the exclusion of other weak 
cognitive skills.  The primary treatment—central nervous system stimulants such as methylphenidate—targets the neurotransmitter dopamine to increase motivation and attention while reducing distractibility
13. Alternatively, 
behavioral therapy addresses the behavior challenges in ADHD rather than the cognitive deficits
14. For example, 
parents are instructed on positive reinforcement techniques to help their child complete a task.  However, in a seminal study on the combination of stimulant medication and behavioral therapy—the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with ADHD (MTA)—there were no significant or lasting improvements in learning or academic outcomes for children who had tried both medication and behavioral therapy interventions
15,16. Further, interventions for ADHD 
in the school setting are limited to accommodations (such as extra time on assignments and preferential seating to reduce distractions) rather than remediations.

Page 5 of 8Cognitive Training for ADHD: Beyond Brain Games
Cognitive training is an alternative treatment approach 
to remediating cognitive deficits associated with ADHD, 
but its effectiveness depends on the cognitive constructs targeted by the training tasks and the method of delivery.  Cognitive training programs for children and adolescents with ADHD include commercial digital ‘brain games,’ clinician-monitored computer-based training exercises, and clinician-delivered hands-on cognitive training programs.  Although engaging, there are several limitations to the use of digital ‘brain games’ and computer-based training for children with ADHD.  First, research on digital brain games applications for ADHD is absent or ambiguous at best
17. For example, Cognifit (www.cognifit.com) is a 
popular digital application designed to train reasoning, coordination, and attention skills; and Nintendo’s Brain Age (www.brainage.nintendo.com ) was designed to train 
attention, speed, memory, and math. However, to our knowledge, neither game has been empirically studied for children with ADHD.  Although digital brain games are appealing to the technology generation, screen time for children with ADHD has its drawbacks.  Most concerning is that extant research indicates video game addiction is higher in children with ADHD
18 who are twice as likely to 
develop pathological gaming behaviors19. 
An alternative approach to using brain games software 
is clinician-monitored digital training for ADHD where 
training is delivered through a digital platform and a clinician (or teacher) monitors the client’s progress and provides feedback each week.  Most of the extant research on this delivery method of training for children with ADHD has been conducted on Cogmed (www.cogmed.com), a computer-based program of 25 sessions completed on a home computer. Well-researched, Cogmed program outcomes consistently include improvement on the trained tasks and increased scores on tests of working memory, a primary deficit in ADHD
20-23. However, in addition to 
the concerns previously outlined about the use of digital training for children with ADHD, there is another drawback to this approach.  The clinician is not engaged with the child or providing dynamic feedback during the training tasks, but, instead, reviews progress at the end of the week in a phone appointment. This does little to increase motivation and treatment compliance during training sessions and fails to target the social cognition deficits we see in this population.  Another limitation to this training paradigm is that the exercises target working memory and attention but not the remaining constructs that are necessary for thinking and learning such as visual and auditory processing, processing speed, long-term memory, and fluid reasoning.  
Another digital brain training program monitored  
by a clinician or teacher is Brain Train (www.braintrain.com), a set of 2000 computer exercises that train various aspects of cognition. Steiner and colleagues
24 conducted a 
pilot trial in a school setting using Brain Train for children with ADHD and found significant improvements in parent ratings of attention and executive function but no objective assessments of cognitive skills were administered. Further, in a subsequent study also conducted by Steiner and colleagues
25 there were no significant improvements in the 
Brain Train group compared to controls.  So, although a strength of the program is that it targets multiple cognitive skills, the research does not yet support its adoption for use with children who are diagnosed with ADHD.   A third brain training program marketed for children with ADHD is Activate (www.C8Sciences.com ), a digital 
program used in classrooms along with physical exercises designed to enhance brain function.  Early research on Activate training in general education classrooms showed significant improvement in executive functions and on state-administered reading and math assessments
26,27, but 
multi-site research with children diagnosed with ADHD failed to show significant improvements on any outcome measured
28.
Given the potential downsides and equivocal research 
outcomes of brain games and digital training for children with ADHD, we advocate for clinicians to consider using a cognitive training intervention delivered by a human being and not a computer or mobile device. By working one-on-one with a child, a clinician can give instant feedback, celebrate successes, encourage the child to push through his frustrations to conquer the training tasks, promote adherence to the intervention, and increase the chances of finding transfer effects.  Because social cognition is frequently underdeveloped in children with ADHD
29, an 
adult-mediated training experience with dynamic feedback, modeling, and verbal encouragement in mastering the tasks may better support not only cognitive development but social-emotional development and self-efficacy for learning as well
30.   A clinician-delivered cognitive training approach 
combines the one-on-one attention found in behavioral therapy and tutoring with engaging mental exercises that should exceed what we can expect from digital training products.  As Reuben Feuerstein has taught us, cognition is malleable and can be changed with purposeful coaching by an adult
31. We haven’t yet met a computer that can coach 
effectively by itself. 
Clinician-Delivered Cognitive Training for ADHD
There is a growing convergence of evidence on the 
benefits of clinician-delivered cognitive training for remediating cognitive deficits associated with ADHD.   Moore and colleagues have evaluated the efficacy of one such program—LearningRx—in several studies across diagnostic groups. LearningRx is a face-to-face cognitive training program created more than 20 years ",paper7.pdf,3

Page 6 of 8ago initially to help struggling readers (www.learningrx.
com).  The core program, called ThinkRx32, is a 60 to 90-
hour intervention delivered in 90-minute training sessions in a clinic or learning center 4 or 5 days per week.  Using repeated engagement with a combination of 23 different mental training exercises with more than 1000 variations, a clinician, therapist, or cognitive trainer adapts the level of intensity of each task using a metronome or a timer, carefully following a sequenced approach to delivering the curriculum that targets multiple cognitive skills including working and long-term memory, attention, processing speed, visual and auditory processing, logic and reasoning, and many subskills such as saccadic fixation, phonemic awareness, working memory capacity, and divided attention.  All training tasks are delivered across a table from the client using a variety of hands-on manipulatives including cards, tangrams, puzzles, and even a footbag to integrate motor skills.  See Figure 2 for an illustration of a visual processing training task.  The clinician creates a focused and demanding training session in a shared space with deliberate distractions to tax the client’s focus and attentional capacity while giving dynamic feedback, encouragement, coaching, and High 5’s.  An optional 60-hour intensive reading or math intervention can be delivered on top of ThinkRx through a cognitive training approach for clients who need additional help with reading skills or math fluency development.  
Research results on LearningRx training for ADHD are 
early but encouraging.  In a randomized controlled trial
33, 
treatment group participants with ADHD who completed 60 hours of ThinkRx cognitive training not only saw clinically-significant changes in cognitive skills—including an average IQ score increase of 26 points—they also reported improvements in school performance, confidence and self-esteem, cooperation and relationships, self-discipline, sleep habits, and sports and hobby performance.  The treatment group outperformed the control group on all cognitive measures with significant differences between 5 of the 7 constructs.  Although the sample size was small, these outcomes were consistent with the results from several other studies on LearningRx cognitive training interventions (ThinkRx and ReadRx) for children and adolescents with learning struggles including ADHD
34-38, 
soldiers with traumatic brain injury39, and adults over age 
50 with memory and attention complaints40. In one study 
of 61 children with learning disabilities including attention 
deficits, the treatment group outperformed the control group on all measures with significant differences noted on measures of long-term memory, logic and reasoning, working memory, processing speed, auditory processing, and Word Attack skills after completing 120 hours of LearningRx cognitive training
35.  In a larger study of 178 
children with learning disabilities including 39 with ADHD, Jedlicka
36 found transfer effects in both treatment groups 
(90 hours of ThinkRx and 120 hours of ThinkRx plus a reading intervention called ReadRx) to parent-reported ratings of academic skills, cognition, and oppositional behavior as well as significant changes with large effect sizes on objective tests of long-term memory, working memory, visual and auditory processing, processing speed, fluid reasoning, and attention.  The research results are consistent as well with a large observational study conducted by Moore
41 with 5,902 children with ADHD who 
completed an average of 80 cognitive training hours across 70 cognitive training centers in the United States.  The mean pretest to post-test change in IQ score was 14 points along with statistically significant changes in scores on tests of long-term memory, visual processing, auditory processing, fluid reasoning, processing speed, working memory, and sustained attention.  Although not a controlled study, the ecologically valid results illustrate real-life clinical outcomes for clients who completed this training.    
Future Directions for Cognitive Training in ADHD
The use of cognitive training in treatment for ADHD 
thus far has been controversial and research results are 
inconsistent from method to method.  However, a closer look at the individual approaches revealed that targeting 
multiple cognitive constructs—rather than working 
memory or attention alone—through human delivery of training tasks has had a significant impact on the trained skills with effects that transferred to everyday functioning such as reduced oppositional behavior, less academic problems, increased confidence and self-esteem, and more cooperative behavior.  Is clinician-delivered cognitive training the promise of the future in ADHD treatment?  In a thought-provoking conceptual piece, Chacko and colleagues
42 suggested that next-generation cognitive 
training programs for ADHD should be paired with behavioral interventions and must target the executive function deficits inherent in ADHD while individualizing the training protocols for each patient.  We, too, believe it has potential to serve as a key element of a holistic approach to treatment.  There are two potential barriers to success, however.  The one-on-one training model can be expensive for the client, and the clinician or cognitive trainer requires training in the delivery of the intervention.

Page 7 of 8Yet, the curriculum fits in a backpack and can be delivered 
not only by clinicians, psychologists, and physicians but also by teachers, special education paraprofessionals, graduate students, retirees, or anyone with a college degree and the cognitive capacity to implement the tasks.  In fact, trainers who deliver the intervention in LearningRx centers in the United States and in BrainRx centers located in 47 countries around the world typically have a bachelor’s degree and 40 hours of training in the curriculum itself.  Research supports this practice as evidenced by a large study
43 
examining characteristics of 150 LearningRx cognitive trainers that found higher degrees were not associated with better outcomes for children with and without ADHD.  By not limiting the delivery of the program to doctoral-level clinicians, more children can be reached and benefit from the intervention.  
The key takeaway for clinicians making decisions about 
interventions is that deficits associated with ADHD extend beyond attention.  In order to have the greatest impact, an intervention must address the multiple cognitive deficits frequently accompanying an ADHD diagnosis and include a human element to promote treatment compliance, motivation, self-efficacy, social cognition, and transfer to real-life benefits.  Future research should include a deeper 
examination of those variables in addition to cognitive 
constructs to further support adoption of a clinician-delivered model of cognitive training for children with ADHD.

Updated July 2017 Classroom Interventions for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder  
 
This packet focuses on classroom intervention strategies to enhance the learning environment for students with attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  An overview of ADHD is 
presented along with a brief description of the challenges students with  ADHD typically 
demonstrate in the classroom.  Strategies for academic interventions, behavior management, and home -school collaboration and communication are also included. 
 
Definition  
 
ADHD is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions of children (Ce nters for Disease 
Control and Prevention, 2015).  The diagnostic term attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorder  
(ADHD) refers to individuals who display patterns of inattention, impulsivity, and overactive behavior that interfere with daily functioning (Am erican Psychiatric Association  [APA] , 2013). 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  (DSM) V (APA, 2013) criteria for diagnosing  ADHD list 
three types of ADHD and the accompanying characteristics.  
 
• Predominantly inattentive type .  
The student may :  
o submit  inaccurate or incomplete work ,  
o have difficulty attending to  conversations , activities , or tasks , 
o be easily  distracted,  
o have difficulty following directions ,  
o frequently lose materials, and/or    
o have difficulty organizing tasks  and materials .  
 
• Predomina ntly hyperactive/impulsive type.   
The student  may :  
o appear to be in constant motion,  
o frequently  fidget  or move in his or her seat , 
o become restless  during quiet activities,   
o leave his or her  seat when expected to remain seated ,   
o interrupt others and classroom activities,  
o talk excessively, and/ or  
o fail to follow classroom procedures (e.g., blurt out answers without raising hand) .  
 
• Combined type.   
The student may exhibit symptoms that include behaviors from both categories above.   
 
In order for a student  to be diagnosed with ADHD, symptoms must appear before age 12 and be 
exhibited across at least two settings . They  must also  have adverse effects on academic 
performance, occupational success, or social -emotional development ( APA , 2013).  To add to 
the complexity of the diagnosis, children with ADHD are likely to have co -existing emotional, 
behavioral, developmental, learning, or physical  conditions  (Wolraich  & DuPa ul, 2010).  As  a ",paper8.pdf,2

Updated July 2017 result of the behaviors  listed above , students with ADHD ar e at greater risk of academic 
difficulties, social/emotional issues, and limited educational outcomes.  
 
The degree to which attention impacts a student’s academic and social performance is related to the interactions between the student’s academic and behavioral needs and the environmental demands.  Therefore, it is not unusual for the student to perform differently across  settings .  For 
example, a student with ADHD may experience academic success in elementary school; however, when he enters middle school, the increased academic and organizational demands 
may increase his need for additional academic and behavioral support s. 
 
Intervention Goals  
 
School interventions should include a team approach across multiple settings , consisting of both 
preventive and i nterve ntion strategies .  Interventions must be based upon assessment data that 
includes information about the student ’s strengths and need s as well as the environmental 
conditions in which her characteristics of ADHD occur.  Progress monitoring and strategy 
adjustments are critical to the success of any intervention plan (Wolraich & DuPaul, 2010).  
 
Academic Interventions  
 
The first step in creating classroom supports for students with ADHD is understand ing the 
students’ strengths and needs . This involves formal and informal assessment, as well as 
collaboration among  educational professionals and the  students’ families .  If a student is not 
responsive  to behavioral strategies and interventions , more intensive interventions , such as 
functional behavior  assessment and behavior intervention plan s, should be considered (see 
Practical FBA ).  No one intervention is universally effective for all students with ADHD.  A 
combination of research -based and promising practices is recommended.  Several of these 
practices are described below.  
 
• Giving D irections  
Many students with ADHD have trouble following directions.  The guidelines below help address this problem.  
 
o Number of Directions: Give a minimal number of directions or  steps at a time.  
If necessary, have s tudents repeat the directions to the teacher or a peer partner.  
 o Form of Directions:  Provide written  directions  or steps,  or a visua l model of a 
completed project. Teach students how to refer to these items  as reminders of 
process steps  to complete tasks . This strategy is particularly helpful for long -term 
projects.  
 
• Written Assignments  
Many students with ADHD have particular challenges  with written  work due to fine -
motor skills  difficulties , motor planning  issues, and difficulty alternating their attention ",paper8.pdf,3

Updated July 2017 from a book to their written response s.  Students with ADHD may  also need assistan ce 
breaking a larger task or project into smaller, more workable units.   
 
The following strategies can be used to address these needs .  
 
      •  Deconstruct ing Tasks: Break tasks into smaller units.  
o Limit amount of work per page.  
o Cover up part of the wor k on a page.  
o Allow extra time for completing tasks . 
o Provide  work breaks.  
o Allow student to use a computer to type or to use speech -to-text software.  
o Reduce the length of written assignment s. 
 
• Organization  
Many students with ADHD have significant di fficulties with organization . They are more 
likely to respond positively when teachers e stablish class routines and set procedures and 
maintain a well -organized learning environment .  Clear rules and advanced planning are 
keys to success for teachers of st udents with ADHD.   
 The following organizational supports are particularly useful.  Students should be taught to use these tools through teacher modeling and guided practice with feedback before being expected to use them more independently.  
 
o Assignment N otebook: Provide the student with an assignment notebook to help 
organize homework and seatwork.  
 o Color -Coded Folders: Provide the student with color -coded folders to help 
organize assignments for different academic subjects.  
 o Homework Partners: Assign the  student a partner who can help record 
homework and other seatwork in the proper folders and assignment book. 
 o Clean Out Dates: Periodically ask the student to sort through and clean out his or her desk, book bag, and other special places where written assignments are stored.  
 
o Extra Books: Provide the student with an extra set of books or electronic versions of books for use at home.  This eliminates  the student  having to 
remember to bring books back and forth.  
 o Use of Calendars: Teach the student to use  a calendar for schedul ing 
assignments.  Tape a schedule of planned daily activities to the student’s desk to help with time management  and transitions. 
 o Checklist of Homework Supplies:  Give the student a checklist that identifies 
categories of items needed for homework assignments.  The checklist can be taped to the inside of the student’s locker or desk.   ",paper8.pdf,4

Updated July 2017  
Classroom  Considerations  
 
The culture of the clas sroom can either support  or create barriers to student success (Piffner, 
2011).  Factors that foster attention, positive behavior, and academic and social success include 
establishing positive relationships with students, adopting classroom management techniques, and creating a physical arrangement that facilitate s learning.   
 It is often a positive relationship with one teacher that facilitates school success for a student 
with ADHD (Piffner, 2011).  When teachers connect with students and appreciat e their unique 
skills and interests,  students are more likely to strive for achievement and positively respond to 
classroom  rules and procedures .   
 When using a  proactive a pproach to classroom management, teachers s upport all students and 
create conditions that prepare them for learning ( Piffner, 2011).  Some strategies  for positive 
management  include clear directions, meaningful feedback, and opportunities for collaboration 
with peers.  Additional strategies are noted below.  
 
• Opportunities to Respond  
Students with ADHD often have the mos t trouble attending during drill- and-practice 
assignments because of the repetitive nature of the tasks.  Peer -mediated approaches such as 
those enumerated below are particularly effective for students with ADHD  in such cases , 
because they increase student s’ opportunities for engagement and active learning ( Piffner, 
2011).  In creating peer -mediated activities, the teacher may need to choose students whose 
skill levels  complement each other.  S tudents with and without attention  difficulties  and 
impulsivity should be considered for peer partnerships .   
 
o Peer Tutoring :  Peer t utoring is one of the more effective strategies for students with 
ADHD, because it provides many of the same supports as one -to-one instruction.  It 
facilitates the acquisition of both academic and social skills.  Peer tutoring is most 
effective when training is provided to participating students (Piffner, 2011).  Tutors need  to be taught how to be prepared with materials needed for the session  and how 
to give positive and corrective feedback to their partner ( Greenwood & Delquadri, 
1995).   
 o Cooperative Learning:  Carefully structured cooperative learning groups in which 
each student is assigned a role and has clear expectations for desired outcomes are very helpful for students with ADHD. The more structured the cooperative activity, the more likely  it is that these students will succe ed.  
 o Sharing Strategies: Think, Pair, Share/Square Share/Group Share: Using this approach, students work with peer partners to discuss the lesson, check each other’s work, and share strategies. 
 ",paper8.pdf,5

T/TAC W&M, 1 -800-323-4489 
Updated July 2017 o Partner Reading:  Student partners take turns reading orally and listening to each 
other.  Peer part ners can also be helpful with  discussing answers to comprehension 
questions, spelling, proofreading, and solving  math  problems . 
 
o Self-Correction Opportunities: Students use calculators or a key provided by the 
teacher  to check their answers . 
 o Learning Games: Students play board games that reinforce skills such as sight vocabulary, phonics, grammar rules, and basic math facts.  For example, Bingo can be 
used to review basic facts and concepts.  Students who require more immediate feedback and re cognition of their efforts might begin with a Bingo board that has only 
three cells across and three cells down.  The number of cells can be gradually increased to four across, four down, then five, and so forth. 
 o Computer Games:  Computer games increase op portunities for responding and active 
engagement  and provide  immediate feedback about accuracy.  In addition, many 
students with ADHD find computer learning games highly reinforcing.  
 o Student -Created Reviews: Students can create ways of reviewing previous ly taught 
content.  For example, they may  create questions and answers for a card game  such as 
Go Fish or Concentration. 
 o Frequent Redirection: Learning partners can be assigned to help each other stay on 
task.   
 
o Transition Buddies: Transition buddies are  helpful for s tudents with ADHD who  
have trouble refocusing their attention as they transition from one academic lesson to the next.  Further, verbal or nonverbal teacher cues signaling upcoming transitions 
help prepare students for change s in activities or lessons . 
 
• Seating Arrangements: Seat the student with ADHD away from distractions and close to 
the teaching action.  
 
o Place the student in close proximity to instruction so the teacher can monitor the 
student’s  work.  
 o Place the student by peers who are attentive workers.  
 o Place the student away from distractions such as windows, the pencil sharpener, the door, and other high -traffic areas.  
 o Add distance between student desks. 
 
o For independent work, use desks with attached chairs rather than tables where several students are seated.

T/TAC W&M, 1 -800-323-4489 
Updated July 2017 o If the student has a high need for movement, seating her near the back of the room  
may provide opportunities to move without distracting peers.  
 
Behavior Management Strategies  
 
The goal of behavior management strategies is to help students learn to  manage their own 
behavior.  The following strategies are most effective when used in conjunction with evidence -
based instructional strategies .  
 
Prevention Strategies  
The following are preventive measures  that support student s in demonstrating  positive  
behavior.  
 
o Nonverbal Supports : Together with the  student, develop inconspicuous, 
nonverbal messages such as eye contact, hand gesture s, or other signal s that teach 
students to recognize the conditions that trigger  specific behaviors.  Once the 
system is developed, students can learn to manage their behavioral responses 
before they occur .  For example, creat ing a signal and routine for “taking  a five -
minute break”  at a specified classroom location  provides an opportunity for the 
student  to recognize when he is becoming  restless or  frustrated and prevent s 
behavior from escalating.  This  system is most effective if used before the 
behavior escalates or intensifies.  
 o Choice as Reward: Choice in and of itself appears to be highly reinforcing.  Provide choice s of activities between assignments or embed choices within 
assignments (e.g., choice of materials, readings, response modes, peer partners).  Choices also provide students practice in decision making.   
 o Checking With Chimes:  In order to teach students to monitor their attention to 
task, set reminders at random intervals  on an electronic device, such as a 
smartphone  or kitchen timer .  Time  intervals should be set based on the student’s 
attention span and the pace of the lesson (typically 3 to 5 minute s).  When the 
tone sounds, the student charts or marks whether she is engaged in learning.  A simple yes or no checklis t works well.  Students can monitor their own behaviors 
by giving themselves points or checkmarks for appropriate behavior.  Extra points may be awarded when student and teacher ratings match.  The student could then chart her score using a computer program, tablet, s martphone, graph paper, or 
poster board.  
 o Visual and Environmental Prompts : Use behavioral and environmental 
prom pts to increase desired classroom behaviors. For example, p ictorial prompts 
of students attending i n class serve as a remind er of the teacher’s expectations for 
learning and behavior.  Electronic visual aids such as interactive whiteboards and document cam eras are helpful for capturing the attention of students with ADHD ",paper8.pdf,7

T/TAC W&M, 1 -800-323-4489 
Updated July 2017 (Piffner, 2011).  Additionally , the use of tablets and computers may engage 
students more fully in learning activities.  
 
o Priming Procedure:  Prime the student before an assignment or lesson by 
reviewing a list of student -identified  privileges or reinforcements  that can be 
earned following a spe cified work period.  
 o Proximity Control: Teacher  proximity is highly effective for helping students 
with ADHD maintain attention . For example, the teacher may m ove closer to the 
student when giving directions  and monitoring seatwork.   
 o Timers: S et a timer  to indicate  how much time remains in the lesson  or work 
period. The timer should be clearly visible  so students can check  remaining time  
and monitor their progress.   
 o Wristwatch or Smart phone: Teach the student to use a wristwatch or 
smartphone to manage time when completing assigned work.  Many watches and 
smartp hones have  built -in timers that can be programmed to beep at set intervals.   
 o Music: Play different levels and tempos of music to help students understand the activity level appropriate for particular lessons.  For example, using quiet classical music for individual learning activities help s block distractions and creat es a calm 
classroom e nvironment (U.S. Department of Education, 2006). 
 
• Reinforcement Strategies  
Children with ADHD require specific and frequent feedback and/or reinforcement  
immediately following the demonstr ation of desired behaviors . When students are 
learning  new behaviors, it is generally important to reinforce close approximations first 
as a way to shape behavior.  Once a behavior is established, the frequency of reinforcement can be gradually decreased . Students with ADHD tend to quickly lose 
interest  with repetition, so a variety of easy-to-implement reinforcers should be 
considered.  
 
o Praise, Praise, Praise: Attentiveness and appropriate classroom behavior are prerequisites for learning; therefore, interventions that promote the se behaviors  
should be an integral part of the teaching process for all students . When teachers 
are attentive to positive behavior and specifically praise students for these behaviors, they can engage students before their attention drifts while highlight ing 
desired behavior (U.S. Department of Education, 2006).  Effective praise statements (a) are contingent on the demonstration of desi red behavior, (b) 
specifically describe the positive behavior, and (c) are provided  immediately and 
enthusiastically following the desired behavior (Scheuermann & Hall, in press ). 
 o Home -School Reinforcement System: One of the most reinforcement effective 
strategies is collaboration with students’ parents.  Communicate as frequently as 
possible  (daily is optimal) about the amount and quality of work, as well as the ",paper8.pdf,8

Considerations: ADHD  
T/TAC W&M, 1 -800-323-4489 
Updated July 2017 increase or decrease in appropriate behavior to help parents coordinate their 
reinforcement s ystem with the school’s system.  A simple checklist consisting of 
a list of  the desired behaviors and a place for assignments  that can be checked off, 
along with space  for special notes , works best.  
 
• Verbal Feedback  
 
Verbal feedback is comprised of both praise and corrective stat ements .  Consider the 
following when designing a behavioral plan.  
 
o Verbal Praise:  Use simple , but specific , praise phrases that clearly identify the 
desired behaviors. For example, “ Larry, t hank you for raising your hand before 
answering the question” lets the student know the specific behavior and condition for which he was praised . General praise (e.g., “good job”) is less meaningful for 
students .   
 o Verbal Redirection: Many students with ADHD  require frequent redirect ion.  
Redirect students using clear, concise, and inconspicuously delivered verbal cues  
to remind students of desired behaviors, rather than long explanations.  
 o Corrective Feedback:  Some student s with ADHD require brief, simple 
correction for disruptive behaviors . Correction  should be  directed at the student’s 
behavior, not the student (e.g., “ No shout -outs. Please raise your hand before 
answering the question ” vs. “stop being disruptive! ”). Provide t he feedback  
immediately follo wing the behavior. Provide correction in a calm manner and in 
close proximity to the student (Piffner, 2011).  Avoid humiliating the student when correcting his behavior. 
 o Options for Students: When providing corrective feedback or redirecting the student , it is often  helpful to provide the student with options .  For example, “Sue, 
you can do the assignment now, during lunch, or after school.”   
 
Home -School  Collaboration and Communication  
 
Families are invaluable resources  for teacher s.  Ongoing communication with the ir child’s 
teacher allows parents to become familiar with classroom  expectations and allows them to follow 
up at home.  Communication also lets teachers know techniques that are working in the home setting.  The following strategies a re designed to increase home- school communication. 
 
• Daily Notes: Make use of checklists and charts to keep parents informed of the student’s 
progress on a daily basis.  Note the effective reinforcement techniques used in the 
classroom.  
 ",paper8.pdf,9

T/TAC W&M, 1 -800-323-4489 
Updated July 2017 • E-mail: Provide par ents with an e-mail address to increase timely communication .  If 
they do not have easy access to e -mail, provide them with telephone numbers and optimal 
times for calling.   
 
• Websites: A homework website that provides assignments for the week is very helpf ul to 
parents  and guardians  of students with ADHD.  Class news regarding projects and the 
week’s instructional topics can also be posted.  
 
• Homework Hotline: A  homework hotline that gives the assignments for the night and  
also provides helpful suggestions for completing them  can help families support their 
children’s work completion.  
 
Word of Caution  
 
Medications are often part of the treatment plan for students with ADHD.  Only medical 
professionals can diagnose ADHD and prescribe medications.  Educators should share the behaviors they are observing in the classroom with family but refrain from suggesting medical conditions such as ADHD or recommending medications to treat them. 
 
Conclusion  
 
Addressing the needs of students with A DHD is  complex and  requires teachers to assess not only 
the student’s unique needs but also the demands of the environment.  Prevent ion strategies that 
address environmental variables should always be the first consideration when designing interve ntions for students with ADHD. Most successful interventions are a combination of 
classroom supports and strategies taught directly to students to help them become more academically and behaviorally successful.

"How Cognitive Learning Empowers Students With
ADHD
 Mar 01, 2024 • Learning Challenges (Https://Www.Oxfordlearning.Com/Category/Learning-Challenges/)
Learning can present unique challenges for individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD). However, by employing personalized strategies and receiving appropriate
support, students with ADHD can significantly enhance their cognitive abilities and succeed
academically.
Cognitive learning is a style of learning that encourages students to use their brains more
effectively. This way of learning encourages students to fully engage in the learning process,
so learning, thinking, and remembering get easier and easier. Cognitive learning is an
effective learning approach that can be tailored to optimize learning outcomes for students
grappling with ADHD.(https://www.oxfordlearning.com)",paper9.pdf,1
"Understanding Cognitive Learning and ADHD
Learning Strategies
Learning relies on cognitive skills such as attention, memory, planning, and quick thinking.
However, for students with ADHD, these skills can be challenging to master. ADHD affects not
only attention regulation but also impulse control and organization, making tasks like focusing
in class, remembering information, and staying organized challenging.
Students with ADHD can struggle with following class discussions, retaining information,
managing tasks, and processing information quickly. Recognizing these classroom struggles,
teachers can implement targeted strategies that can help students maximize their learning.
Effective strategies may include:
breaking tasks into smaller steps
providing visual aids for the organization
taking regular breaks
cueing the student before giving directions
using a timer
having the student repeat instructions.(https://www.oxfordlearning.com)",paper9.pdf,2
"Strategies for Students with ADHD to Improve
Learning
Mindfulness techniques, attention-focusing exercises, and attention anchors strategies can
enhance attention and reduce distractions. Break tasks into smaller chunks, stick to
structured routines and apply specific ADHD-learning strategies to stay focused.
For better memory, use mnemonic devices, visualization techniques, and memory aids to
boost retention and recall. Actively engaging in learning, repeating information, and ensuring
adequate sleep are essential for solidifying memory.
Work on organization, planning, time management, and prioritization skills to strengthen
executive functions. Utilize tools like checklists, calendars, and planners, and consider
cognitive-behavioural techniques to address impulsivity and improve decision-making.
Improving processing speed can involve strategies such as chunking information, practising
speed reading, and participating in cognitive training exercises. Additionally, prioritize
physical exercise, sufficient sleep, and healthy lifestyle habits to optimize cognitive
functioning.
Activities like puzzles, games, and brain-training exercises stimulate cognitive processing.
Here are more ways students with ADHD can get more out of their educational experience.

"Individualized Learning Plans
Personalized learning plans tailored to the specific needs and strengths of students with
ADHD are essential. Collaboration between educators, tutors, students, and their
parents/guardians is crucial in developing these customized strategies and
accommodations. 
Ongoing assessment and adjustment ensure that learning plans remain effective and
relevant over time. Examples of individualized learning plans can target specific cognitive
challenges associated with ADHD, such as attention deficits, working memory limitations, and
executive function impairments.

Utilizing Technology and Assistive Tools
Technology and assistive tools can play a significant role in supporting cognitive learning for
students with ADHD. Apps, software programs, and assistive technologies designed to
improve attention, memory, organization, and productivity offer valuable support. 
Individual needs and student preferences should be considered when using technology
tools. Teaching students how to use technology effectively for learning and productivity is
always important. Don’t forget to promote digital literacy and responsible technology use.
Here are some assisted technologies for students with ADHD.

Creating a Supportive Learning Environment
Teachers and tutors need to create a supportive and inclusive learning environment. The
learning environment should foster understanding, empathy, and acceptance of students
with ADHD. 
Educators, tutors, parents, and peers all provide encouragement, motivation, and emotional
support—positive reinforcement, praise, and celebrating progress boost students’
confidence and self-esteem. 
Promoting a positive culture that values diversity, equity, and inclusion ensures that students
with ADHD feel respected, understood, and empowered to succeed.(https://www.oxfordlearning.com)",paper9.pdf,4
