She appears to process and retain information more readily when presented in an auditory format, particularly in working memory tasks.

This suggests a potential area for development, focusing on strengthening her ability to visualize and manipulate spatial information in her mind.\", \"planningAndImpulsivity\": \"Kid's planning abilities are exceptional; however, occasional instances of impulsivity, as evidenced by set errors on Symbol Search, may warrant attention.  Encouraging strategies for self-monitoring and error correction may further enhance her executive functioning skills.\", \"strengths\": \"Kid's overall cognitive profile is marked by exceptional strengths in fluid reasoning, processing speed, and auditory attention.
