Photosynthesis is the process in which green plants (https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/plant/353639) use sunlight to make their own food. Photosynthesis is necessary for life on Earth. Without it there would be no green plants, and without green plants there would be no animals.
Photosynthesis requires sunlight, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide gas. Chlorophyll is a substance in all green plants, especially in the leaves. Plants take in water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air.
Photosynthesis starts when chlorophyll absorbs energy (https://kids.britannica.com/kids/article/energy/353100) from sunlight. Green plants use this light energy to change water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and nutrients called sugars. The plants use some of the sugars and store the rest. The oxygen is released into the air.
Photosynthesis is very important because almost all living things depend on plants for food. Photosynthesis is also important because of the oxygen it produces. Humans and other animals need to breathe in oxygen to survive.
Some living things other than plants also make their own food through photosynthesis. They include certain types of bacteria and algae.
