Working memory is an umbrella term describing all memory tasks (simple span and complex span tasks), but can also be used\\nto describe only complex tasks (storage plus processing).\\nTo avoid confusion, clear operational definitions are essential. Here, the term executive-loaded working memory (ELWM) (Henry,\\n2012) is used to refer to tasks with an attentional or processing load (e.g. complex span tasks). Short-term memory (STM) describes\\nstorage only tasks (simple span tasks) and working memory (WM) is used as an umbrella term to refer to all memory tasks. Tasks are\\nalso defined by modality i.e., verbal or visuospatial. Thus four aspects of WM are delineated (verbal and visuospatial STM and ELWM)\\nto categorise trained tasks and outcome measures. Table 1 provides examples of tasks representing each aspect of WM.\\nAim\\nThe aim is to examine systematically the effectiveness of non-computerised interventions targeting WM in 4–11 year olds applied\\nwithin their everyday contexts.\\nResearch questions\\n1.

Provide choice s of activities between assignments or embed choices within \\nassignments (e.g., choice of materials, readings, response modes, peer partners).  Choices also provide students practice in decision making.   \\n o Checking With Chimes:  In order to teach students to monitor their attention to \\ntask, set reminders at random intervals  on an electronic device, such as a \\nsmartphone  or kitchen timer .  Time  intervals should be set based on the student’s \\nattention span and the pace of the lesson (typically 3 to 5 minute s).  When the \\ntone sounds, the student charts or marks whether she is engaged in learning.  A simple yes or no checklis t works well.  Students can monitor their own behaviors \\nby giving themselves points or checkmarks for appropriate behavior.  Extra points may be awarded when student and teacher ratings match.  The student could then chart her score using a computer program, tablet, s martphone, graph paper, or \\nposter board.  \\n o Visual and Environmental Prompts : Use behavioral and environmental \\nprom pts to increase desired classroom behaviors.

      " Learning with ADHD: A Review of Technologies and Strategies  257 \\nJournal on Technology and Persons with Disabilities  \\nSantiago, J. (Eds): CSUN Assistive Technology Conference  \\n© 2022 California State University, Northridge  In terms of content, both consistency and structure are important for students with ADHD \\n(Sorensen 50). Teachers must focus on maintaining consistency in their communication and \\nlearning material . An effective strateg y for this is to provide templates with appropriate structure \\nto the students for creating content, artifacts and submissions for assessment, note- taking for \\ncomprehension, or communicating (Cinquin 165).  \\nIt could get difficult for students with ADHD to simultaneously work on content and \\nstructure.  Templates serve to scaffold their learning process. Writing templates can offer the \\nstudent a frame for the task at hand. These could be created by teachers using popular software \\nsuch as MS PowerPoint or MS Word.  \\nFrom a pedagogy perspective, several  strategies are reported  to promote consumption and \\nproduction of information by the learner  as well as engagement with the learning process. To \\nmake consumption of learning material easier, teachers  are encouraged to use multi-modal \\nrepresentation and comm unication (Sorensen 53). This helps with providing choices to the \\nstudents to engage through the mode that best suits them. Providing students flexibility for task completion such as  allowing multiple modes for task completion ( oral as well as  written ) \\nfacilitate s submissions. C ommunication  can be facilitated  through building in means for \\ncollaboration and knowledge-building (Sorensen & Andersen 46). \\nEngagement with the learning material is enhanced through information chunking, which \\nrefers to dividing content or assignments into smaller parts or modif ying them to reduce the \\nlength of tasks  to enable students to complete each piece without losing their attention.

Figure 1\\nprovides an overview of the potential mechanisms to improve\\nworking memory.\\nTwo general mechanisms explain the effects of working\\nmemory training (von Bastian and Oberauer, 2014). The first\\nis increased working memory capacity , which enables people to\\nhold more items in their working memory, and the second is\\nincreased efficiency in using available working memory capacity.\\nAt the behavioural level, an increase in working memory\\ncapacity results in performance improvements in tasks on which\\nthe person was not trained, but that share some variance with\\nthe training tasks (Klingberg, 2010). Given that working memory\\ncapacity significantly correlates with several cognitive abilities,\\nthese improvements should manifest in several measures which\\nare independent of the precise materials and structure of the tasks\\n(Schmiedek et al., 2010). In general, two terms are used to define\\nthe transfer of training: (1) near-transfer which refers to gains in\\nabilities directly related to the training task; and (2) far-transfer,\\nwhich are gains in different but related abilities.\\nMeiran, Dreisbach, and von Bastian noted in 2019 that while paper12.pdf            6    0.995399\n"

      "The first step in creating classroom supports for students with ADHD is understand ing the \\nstudents’ strengths and needs . This involves formal and informal assessment, as well as \\ncollaboration among  educational professionals and the  students’ families .  If a student is not \\nresponsive  to behavioral strategies and interventions , more intensive interventions , such as \\nfunctional behavior  assessment and behavior intervention plan s, should be considered (see \\nPractical FBA ).  No one intervention is universally effective for all students with ADHD.  A \\ncombination of research -based and promising practices is recommended.  Several of these \\npractices are described below.  \\n \\n• Giving D irections  \\nMany students with ADHD have trouble following directions.  The guidelines below help address this problem.  \\n \\no Number of Directions: Give a minimal number of directions or  steps at a time.  \\nIf necessary, have s tudents repeat the directions to the teacher or a peer partner.  \\n o Form of Directions:  Provide written  directions  or steps,  or a visua l model of a \\ncompleted project. Teach students how to refer to these items  as reminders of \\nprocess steps  to complete tasks .

Although\\ntraining a variety of neurocognitive functions is appealing at face\\nvalue, meta-analytic evidence indicates that such protocolsproduce smaller near-transfer effects than protocols that focuson a single neurocognitive training target [ 81]. It is presumed that\\nthe reason for this ﬁnding is that the more different cognitive\\n‘muscles ’that we are trying to train, the less time we can spend on\\nany one of those ‘muscles ’. Thus, it appears likely that maximizing\\nefﬁcacy will require separate protocols for each neurocognitive\\nfunction that is impaired in ADHD, combined with a ‘personalized\\nmedicine ’approach in which each child ’s neurocognitive pro ﬁle is\\nestimated at pre-treatment, and then a treatment plan is\\ndeveloped to target each of their identi ﬁed weaknesses. We must\\nleverage basic science to link training targets with behavioral/functional outcomes .

Barkley’s response inhibition\\nmodel suggests that deﬁcient response inhibition is the primary\\nimpairment, leading to executive function deﬁcits including\\nworking memory problems, which result in hyperactivity,\\nimpulsivity, and inattention symptoms ( Barkley, 1997 ). The\\nalternative working memory model, drawing from Baddeley and\\nHitch’s multi-component theory, positions working memory\\ndeﬁcits as a core feature of ADHD ( Rapport et al., 2001 ).\\nThis model, based on Baddeley and Hitch’s multi-component\\nworking memory theory, includes four elements: the central\\nexecutive system, phonological loop, visuospatial sketchpad,\\nand the episodic buﬀer, which work together to coordinate the\\nstorage and processing of information ( RepovŠ and Baddeley, paper14.pdf            2    0.987749\n",

      "        The first step in creating classroom supports for students with ADHD is understand ing the \\nstudents’ strengths and needs . This involves formal and informal assessment, as well as \\ncollaboration among  educational professionals and the  students’ families .  If a student is not \\nresponsive  to behavioral strategies and interventions , more intensive interventions , such as \\nfunctional behavior  assessment and behavior intervention plan s, should be considered (see \\nPractical FBA ).  No one intervention is universally effective for all students with ADHD.  A \\ncombination of research -based and promising practices is recommended.  Several of these \\npractices are described below.  \\n \\n• Giving D irections  \\nMany students with ADHD have trouble following directions.  The guidelines below help address this problem.  \\n \\no Number of Directions: Give a minimal number of directions or  steps at a time.  \\nIf necessary, have s tudents repeat the directions to the teacher or a peer partner.  \\n o Form of Directions:  Provide written  directions  or steps,  or a visua l model of a \\ncompleted project. Teach students how to refer to these items  as reminders of \\nprocess steps  to complete tasks . This strategy is particularly helpful for long -term \\nprojects.  \\n \\n• Written Assignments  \\nMany students with ADHD have particular challenges  with written  work due to fine -  paper8.pdf            3    0.990559\n",

We provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying\\nthe therapeutic benefit of working memory training and identify\\nnovel directions for research to improve ADHD treatment\\nprotocols.\\nWORKING MEMORY\\nWorking memory refers to the active mental workspace that\\ncan briefly hold and manipulate information (Fang et al., 2016).\\nWorking memory capacity determines the rate and level of\\nlearning and predicts performance on mental tasks such as\\nreading comprehension, language acquisition, reasoning, and\\nproblem-solving (Fang et al., 2016; Emch et al., 2019).\\nWorking memory is a hierarchical process that connects\\ndetailed sensory representations to specific behavioural\\nresponses. These are linked viaintermediate task-relevant\\nrepresentations and action plans in a network of different brain\\nareas (Christophel et al., 2017).\\nWorking memory plays a fundamental role in cognition,\\nallowing one to hold information ‘‘in mind.’’ Working memory\\nis defined by its flexibility: people are capable of storing, at least\\ntemporarily, any information.

The cognitive challenges in these games are limited and\\ngenerally do not involve high-intensity memory tasks or complex\\ndecision-making, making their direct impact on working memory\\nrelativelymodest.\\nOn the other hand, the eﬀect of regular aerobic exercise\\nis the weakest (SMD =0.40), which may be attributed to its\\nsimpler exercise format and lower cognitive load. Activities like\\nrunningandskipping,whileimprovingoverallphysicalﬁtnessand\\nstimulating dopamine secretion, can help children with ADHDmaintain attention in the short term ( Kuo et al., 2024 ;Ren paper14.pdf           10    0.990129\n",

The results indicate\\nthat cognitive-aerobic exercise and ball sports are signiﬁcantly\\nmore eﬀective than other types of exercise interventions in\\nimproving working memory. This diﬀerence may be attributed\\nto the varying cognitive load, task complexity, and the degree of\\nactivation of executive functions across diﬀerent exercise types.The ﬁndings suggest that when designing exercise interventions\\nforchildrenwithADHD,priorityshouldbegiventoexercisetypes\\nwith higher cognitive load in order to more eﬀectively enhance\\nworkingmemory.\\nData availability statement\\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included\\nin the article/ Supplementarymaterial , further inquiries can be\\ndirectedtothecorrespondingauthor.\\nAuthor contributions paper14.pdf           11    0.990027\n"
